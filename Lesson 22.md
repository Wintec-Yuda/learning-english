### **Lesson 22: Past Continuous Tense (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What is the Past Continuous Tense?**
The past continuous tense describes actions that were **ongoing** or **in progress** at a specific time in the past. It’s formed with **was** or **were** + a verb ending in **-ing**.  
- Example: “I **was** eating rice.” (You were in the middle of eating.)  
- Example: “They **were** playing games.” (They were playing at that time.)  

This tense is super common in everyday English, like texting “I **was** sleeping when you called” or posting “We **were** partying last night!” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Forming the Past Continuous**
Use **was** (for I, he, she, it) or **were** (for you, we, they) + the **verb + -ing** (present participle).  
- Structure: **Subject + Was/Were + Verb-ing (+ Object)**  
- For **I, He, She, It**: Use **was**.  
  - Example: “I **was** reading a book.”  
  - Example: “She **was** watching TV.”  
- For **You, We, They**: Use **were**.  
  - Example: “They **were** playing soccer.”  
  - Example: “We **were** talking to friends.”  
- **Forming the -ing Verb**: Same as present continuous:  
  - Most verbs: Add **-ing** (e.g., play → **playing**, eat → **eating**).  
  - Verbs ending in -e: Drop -e, add **-ing** (e.g., write → **writing**, dance → **dancing**).  
  - Short verbs with consonant-vowel-consonant: Double the last consonant (e.g., run → **running**, sit → **sitting**).  

#### **2. Uses of Past Continuous**
- **Ongoing Actions in the Past**: Actions happening at a specific past moment.  
  - Example: “I **was** studying at 8 PM yesterday.” (In progress at that time.)  
- **Background Actions**: Sets the scene for another past event (often with simple past).  
  - Example: “I **was** sleeping when you **called**.” (Was sleeping = ongoing; called = interrupting action.)  
- **Two Ongoing Actions**: Two actions happening at the same time, often with **while**.  
  - Example: “She **was** reading **while** he **was** cooking.”  
- **Temporary Past Actions**: Actions happening around a past time, not permanent.  
  - Example: “They **were** living in London last year.” (Temporary.)  

#### **3. Negative Sentences**
Add **not** after **was** or **were** (contractions: **wasn’t**, **weren’t**).  
- Structure: **Subject + Was/Were + Not + Verb-ing (+ Object)**  
  - Example: “I **wasn’t** eating rice.”  
  - Example: “They **weren’t** playing outside.”  
  - Example: “She **was not** listening to music.”  

#### **4. Questions in Past Continuous**
- **Yes/No Questions**: Use **Was/Were + Subject + Verb-ing (+ Object)?**  
  - Example: “**Was** she **reading** a book?” (Answer: “Yes, she **was**.”)  
  - Example: “**Were** you **watching** TV?” (Answer: “No, I **wasn’t**.”)  
- **Wh-Questions**: Use **Wh-Word + Was/Were + Subject + Verb-ing?**  
  - Example: “**What** **were** you **doing** yesterday?” (Answer: “I **was** studying.”)  
  - Example: “**Where** **was** he **going**?” (Answer: “He **was** going to the shop.”)  

#### **5. Combining with Simple Past**
The past continuous often pairs with the **simple past** to show an ongoing action interrupted by a shorter action, using **when** or **while**.  
- **When + Simple Past**: The simple past action interrupts the ongoing action.  
  - Example: “I **was** eating **when** the phone **rang**.” (Eating = ongoing; rang = interruption.)  
- **While + Past Continuous**: Emphasizes the ongoing action.  
  - Example: “**While** I **was** eating, the phone **rang**.” (Same as above, focus on eating.)  
- Two Past Continuous: Use **while** for two ongoing actions.  
  - Example: “I **was** reading **while** she **was** writing.”  

#### **6. Combining with Other Concepts**
The past continuous works with **countable/uncountable nouns**, **quantifiers**, **modal verbs**, **adverbs of frequency**, **comparatives/superlatives**, **possessives**, **demonstratives**, **conjunctions**, **prepositions**, and **adjectives**.  
- Simple Past: “**My** friend **was** eating **a few** **tasty** apples **when** I **arrived** **yesterday**.” (My = possessive, a few = quantifier, tasty = adjective, when = conjunction, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Future: “**Will** you **be** thinking about **this** **better** plan **tomorrow**?” (Will = future, this = demonstrative, better = comparative, tomorrow = adverb.)  
- Modal Verbs: “**Her** team **could** have been **playing** **more** aggressively **yesterday**.” (Her = possessive, could = modal, more = quantifier, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Adverbs of Frequency: “**Their** kids **were** **always** running **in** the park **last summer**.” (Their = possessive, always = adverb of frequency, in = preposition.)  
- Countable/Uncountable: “**Some** friends **were** drinking **a little** coffee **and** **mine** **was** **the best**.” (Some/a little = quantifiers, mine = possessive pronoun, the best = superlative, and = conjunction.)  

**Time Words for Past Continuous**: Words like **yesterday**, **last night**, **at 8 PM**, **last week**, or **last summer** often signal the past.  
- Example: “I **was** studying **last night**.”

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (past continuous markers and related words) for everyday conversations:  
1. **Was** (past of “to be” for I/he/she/it)  
   - Example: “I **was** reading.”  
2. **Were** (past of “to be” for you/we/they)  
   - Example: “They **were** playing.”  
3. **While** (conjunction for simultaneous actions)  
   - Example: “I **was** eating **while** she **was** talking.”  
4. **Talking** (speaking, verb)  
   - Example: “We **were** talking to friends.”  
5. **Last** (previous time, adjective)  
   - Example: “I **was** busy **last** night.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: These words are great for storytelling about the past. Notice them in texts or posts, like “I **was** chilling **last** night” or “We **were** talking.” Try saying one aloud, like “I **was** eating **last** night,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with the past continuous, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “Was” sounds like /wəz/ (like “buzz” with “w”).  
  - “Were” sounds like /wɜːr/ (like “fur” with “w”).  
  - “While” sounds like /waɪl/ (like “smile” with “w”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “Was, was, was.”  
- **Stress the Action for Ongoing Feel**: Stressing the **-ing** verb emphasizes the ongoing nature.  
  - Example: “I **was** *EATING* rice!” (Stress “eating” to show it was in progress.)  
  - Example: “They **were** *PLAYING* all day!” (Stress “playing” to highlight.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using the past continuous when sharing past events, like “I **was** texting you **last** night” when chatting or “I **was** eating when you **called**” when explaining.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for past continuous (e.g., “I **was** trying to sleep” or “We **were** having fun”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “I **was** eating rice **when** you **called**.”  
- Stress the action: “I **was** *EATING* rice **when** you *CALLED*.”  
- Try it like you’re telling a friend what happened.

### **Modern Examples**
The past continuous tense is everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “I **was** drinking **some** coffee **last** night ☕” (was = past continuous, some = quantifier, last = adjective).  
- Text to a friend: “**Were** you **watching** **that** movie **when** I **texted**? 📺” (were = past continuous, that = demonstrative, when = conjunction).  
- Tweet: “**My** friends **were** dancing **and** I **was** singing **yesterday** 🎶” (my = possessive, were = past continuous, and = conjunction, yesterday = adverb).  
- YouTube comment: “We **weren’t** sleeping, we **were** partying **last** weekend 🎉” (weren’t/were = past continuous, last = adjective).  

These examples show how the past continuous adds vivid detail to past events in modern, casual communication.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Use **was/were** + **verb-ing**: “I **was** reading.”  
  - Uses: Ongoing past actions (“She **was** eating”), background for simple past (“I **was** sleeping **when** you **called**”), or simultaneous actions (“I **was** reading **while** he **was** cooking”).  
  - Negatives: **wasn’t/weren’t** + verb-ing (“I **wasn’t** eating”).  
  - Questions: **Was/Were** + subject + verb-ing (“**Were** you **playing**?”).  
  - Combine with simple past, quantifiers, etc.: “**My** friend **was** eating **a few** **tasty** apples **when** I **arrived** **yesterday**.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **was, were, while, talking, last** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce “was/were” clearly, stress the **-ing** verb for ongoing actions, and use in casual settings like texts or chats.
