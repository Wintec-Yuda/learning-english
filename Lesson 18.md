### **Lesson 18: Modal Verbs (can, must, should) (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Modal Verbs?**
Modal verbs are special verbs that show **ability**, **permission**, **obligation**, **advice**, or **possibility**. They don’t change form (no “-s” or “-ing”) and are followed by a **base verb**. This lesson focuses on three beginner-friendly modals: **can**, **must**, and **should**.  
- Example: “I **can** swim.” (Shows ability to swim.)  
- Example: “You **must** study.” (Shows obligation to study.)  
- Example: “She **should** rest.” (Gives advice to rest.)  

Modal verbs are super common in everyday English, like texting “I **can** meet you later” or posting “We **should** try this!” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Forming Sentences with Modal Verbs**
Modal verbs are followed by the **base verb** (no “to,” “-s,” or “-ing”). They work with all subjects (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) without changing form.  
- Structure: **Subject + Modal Verb (can/must/should) + Base Verb (+ Object)**  
- **Can**: Shows ability (able to do something) or permission (allowed to do something).  
  - Example: “I **can** play soccer.” (Ability.)  
  - Example: “You **can** use my phone.” (Permission.)  
- **Must**: Shows obligation (something you have to do) or logical necessity.  
  - Example: “You **must** wear a helmet.” (Obligation.)  
  - Example: “It **must** be cold outside.” (Logical conclusion.)  
- **Should**: Gives advice (what is a good idea) or suggestions.  
  - Example: “She **should** study for the test.” (Advice.)  
  - Example: “We **should** go to the park.” (Suggestion.)  
- **Note**: No “to” after modals (e.g., “I **can** swim,” not “I can **to** swim”).  

#### **2. Negative Sentences with Modal Verbs**
Add **not** after the modal verb (often with contractions: **can’t**, **mustn’t**, **shouldn’t**).  
- Structure: **Subject + Modal Verb + Not + Base Verb (+ Object)**  
- **Can’t** (cannot): Shows lack of ability or prohibition.  
  - Example: “I **can’t** sing well.” (No ability.)  
  - Example: “You **can’t** park here.” (Not allowed.)  
- **Mustn’t**: Shows prohibition (something you’re not allowed to do).  
  - Example: “You **mustn’t** touch the hot stove.” (Forbidden.)  
- **Shouldn’t**: Advises against something (not a good idea).  
  - Example: “You **shouldn’t** eat too much sugar.” (Advice against.)  
- **Note**: **Mustn’t** is for prohibition; **don’t have to** (not a modal) means no obligation.  
  - Example: “You **mustn’t** run in the hall.” (Forbidden.)  
  - Example: “You **don’t have to** run.” (Optional, not required.)  

#### **3. Questions with Modal Verbs**
Invert the modal verb and subject to form questions.  
- Structure: **Modal Verb + Subject + Base Verb (+ Object)?**  
- **Can**: Asks about ability or permission.  
  - Example: “**Can** you **help** me?” (Ability.)  
  - Example: “**Can** I **come** in?” (Permission.)  
  - Answers: “Yes, I **can**.” or “No, I **can’t**.”  
- **Must**: Asks about necessity (less common, formal).  
  - Example: “**Must** we **finish** this now?” (Is it required?)  
  - Answers: “Yes, you **must**.” or “No, you **don’t have to**.”  
- **Should**: Asks for advice or suggestions.  
  - Example: “**Should** I **call** her?” (Is it a good idea?)  
  - Answers: “Yes, you **should**.” or “No, you **shouldn’t**.”  

#### **4. Combining with Other Concepts**
Modal verbs work with **simple present**, **past** (using forms like “could”), **future**, **present continuous**, **countable/uncountable nouns**, **quantifiers**, **adjectives**, **prepositions**, **demonstratives**, **possessives**, and **conjunctions**.  
- Present: “**My** friend **can** eat **a lot of** pizza **in** the kitchen **now**.” (My = possessive, a lot of = quantifier, in = preposition, now = adverb.)  
- Past (with “could” for can): “**This** child **could** read **many** books **yesterday**.” (This = demonstrative, many = quantifier, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Future: “**Those** students **should** study **more** **tomorrow**.” (Those = demonstrative, more = quantifier, tomorrow = adverb.)  
- Present Continuous: “**Her** team **is** practicing **and** **can** win.” (Her = possessive, is = present continuous, and = conjunction.)  
- Negative: “**These** snacks **can’t** be **too** spicy.” (These = demonstrative, too = adverb.)  
- Question: “**Can** **a few** friends **come** **or** **should** I **wait**?” (A few = quantifier, or = conjunction.)  

#### **5. Modal Verbs with Countable and Uncountable Nouns**
- Countable: Use with numbers, **many**, **a few**, etc.  
  - Example: “I **can** buy **a few** apples.”  
  - Example: “You **shouldn’t** eat **many** candies.”  
- Uncountable: Use with **some**, **much**, **a little**, etc.  
  - Example: “We **can** drink **some** water.”  
  - Example: “You **mustn’t** waste **much** time.”

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**

1. **Can** (ability or permission)  
   - Example: “I **can** swim.”  
2. **Must** (obligation or necessity)  
   - Example: “You **must** study.”  
3. **Should** (advice or suggestion)

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with modal verbs, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “Can” sounds like /kæn/ (like “can” in “candy”; in fast speech, /kən/).  
  - “Must” sounds like /mʌst/ (like “must” in “mustard”).  
  - “Should” sounds like /ʃʊd/ (like “good” with “sh”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “Can, can, can.”  
- **Stress Modals for Emphasis**: Stressing modals shows importance or urgency.  
  - Example: “You *MUST* study!” (Stress “must” to emphasize obligation.)  
  - Example: “I *CAN* do it!” (Stress “can” to show ability.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using modals when planning or advising, like “I **can** meet you **later**” when texting or “You **should** try this” when suggesting food.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for modals (e.g., “I **can** do this” or “You **should** check it out”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “I **can** help you **now**.”  
- Stress the modal: “I *CAN* help you *NOW*.”  
- Try it like you’re offering assistance to a friend.

### **Modern Examples**
Modal verbs are everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “I **can** eat **a lot of** pizza **now** 🍕” (can = modal, a lot of = quantifier, now = adverb).  
- Text to a friend: “**Should** I **buy** **this** shirt **or** **that** one? 👕” (should = modal, this/that = demonstratives, or = conjunction).  
- Tweet: “You **must** try **some** coffee **here** ☕” (must = modal, some = quantifier, here = adverb).  
- YouTube comment: “We **can’t** wait **and** **should** go **tomorrow** 🎉” (can’t/should = modals, and = conjunction, tomorrow = adverb).  

These examples show how modal verbs add flexibility and expressiveness to modern, casual communication.

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Use **can** (ability/permission), **must** (obligation), **should** (advice) + **base verb**: “I **can** swim.”  
  - Negatives: **can’t** (no ability/prohibited), **mustn’t** (prohibited), **shouldn’t** (not advised): “You **mustn’t** run.”  
  - Questions: **Modal + Subject + Base Verb**: “**Can** you **help**?”  
  - Combine with countable/uncountable nouns, quantifiers, etc.: “**My** friend **can** eat **a few** **tasty** apples **in** the kitchen **now**.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **can, must, should, help, rest** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce modals clearly, stress them for emphasis, and use in casual settings like texts or chats.
