# Adverbs Material

## What are Adverbs?
Adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, showing **how**, **when**, **where**, or **how often** something happens.  
- Example: “She sings **loudly**.” (How she sings.)  
- Example: “I go **home**.” (Where I go.)  

## Grammar Rules
1. **Types of Adverbs**:  
   - Manner (how): loudly, quietly, fast, well  
     - Example: “He talks **quietly**.”  
   - Time (when): now, today, always, never  
     - Example: “I eat **now**.”  
   - Place (where): here, there, home, outside  
     - Example: “We play **outside**.”  
   - Frequency (how often): always, often, never  
     - Example: “They **often** play.”  
2. **Position**:  
   - Manner: After verb/object (e.g., “She sings **loudly**.”)  
   - Time: End or start (e.g., “I go **today**.” or “**Today**, I go.”)  
   - Place: After verb (e.g., “We play **outside**.”)  
   - Frequency: Before main verb (e.g., “I **always** eat.”) or after “to be” (e.g., “She **is** **always** happy.”)  
3. **Forming Adverbs**:  
   - Add **-ly** to adjectives: quiet → quietly, slow → slowly.  
   - Exceptions: fast, well (e.g., “He runs **fast**,” “She sings **well**.”)

## Vocabulary (Adverbs)
- **Quickly**: In a fast way (e.g., “I eat **quickly**.”)  
- **Always**: Every time (e.g., “She **always** smiles.”)  
- **Here**: In this place (e.g., “We play **here**.”)  
- **Well**: In a good way (e.g., “He sings **well**.”)  
- **Never**: Not at all (e.g., “I **never** drink coffee.”)

## Speaking Tips
- Pronounce clearly: “Quickly” (/ˈkwɪk.li/), “Always” (/ˈɔːl.weɪz/), “Well” (/wɛl/).  
- Stress adverbs: “She sings *WELL*!”  
- Use in context: Say “I’m here” when arriving or “I eat quickly” when rushed.  
- Imitate: Repeat after videos (e.g., “I’m always tired”).

## Modern Examples
- Instagram: “I **always** love coffee ☕”  
- Text: “Come **here** now! 📍”  
- Tweet: “She sings **well** 🎤”  
- YouTube: “I **never** watch scary movies 😱”
