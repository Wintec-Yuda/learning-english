### **Lesson 26: First Conditional (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What is the First Conditional?**
The first conditional describes **real and possible** future situations and their **likely results**. It uses **if** to introduce the condition and a result clause, often with **will**.  
- Example: “If it **rains**, I **’ll** stay home.” (Possible condition: rain; likely result: stay home.)  
- Example: “If you **study**, you **’ll** pass the test.” (Possible condition: study; likely result: pass.)  

This structure is super common in everyday English, like texting “If I **finish** early, I **’ll** call you” or posting “If we **win**, we **’ll** celebrate!” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Forming the First Conditional**
The first conditional has two clauses: the **if clause** (condition) and the **result clause**.  
- Structure: **If + Subject + Simple Present, Subject + Will + Base Verb (+ Object)**  
  - **If Clause**: Uses **simple present** to describe the possible condition.  
    - Example: “If it **rains**...” (Present tense for a future possibility.)  
  - **Result Clause**: Uses **will** + base verb to describe the likely result.  
    - Example: “...I **’ll** stay home.” (Will for the future outcome.)  
  - Full Example: “If it **rains**, I **’ll** stay home.”  
- Word Order: The **if clause** can come first or second (use a comma when **if** is first).  
  - Example: “If you **call**, I **’ll** answer.” (Comma after if clause.)  
  - Example: “I **’ll** answer **if** you **call**.” (No comma.)  

#### **2. Uses of the First Conditional**
- **Real Future Possibilities**: Conditions that are possible and their expected results.  
  - Example: “If I **study**, I **’ll** pass.” (Studying is possible, passing is likely.)  
- **Plans and Decisions**: Talking about what you’ll do if something happens.  
  - Example: “If I **finish** early, I **’ll** meet you.” (Plan based on finishing.)  
- **Warnings or Advice**: Suggesting consequences of actions.  
  - Example: “If you **don’t** hurry, you **’ll** be late.” (Warning.)  
- **Offers or Promises**: Committing to an action if a condition is met.  
  - Example: “If you **need** help, I **’ll** come.” (Offer.)  

#### **3. Negative Sentences**
- **If Clause**: Use **don’t/doesn’t** + base verb for negatives in simple present.  
  - Example: “If I **don’t** study, I **’ll** fail.”  
  - Example: “If she **doesn’t** call, we **’ll** leave.”  
- **Result Clause**: Use **won’t** + base verb for negatives.  
  - Example: “If it **rains**, I **won’t** go out.”  
  - Example: “If they **win**, they **won’t** stop celebrating.”  

#### **4. Questions in First Conditional**
- **Yes/No Questions**: Question the result clause with **Will + Subject + Base Verb**.  
  - Example: “If it **rains**, **will** you **stay** home?” (Answer: “Yes, I **will**.”)  
  - Example: “If I **call**, **will** you **answer**?” (Answer: “No, I **won’t**.”)  
- **Wh-Questions**: Use **Wh-Word + Will + Subject + Base Verb**.  
  - Example: “If you **study**, **what** **will** you **do** after?” (Answer: “I **’ll** relax.”)  
  - Example: “If we **go**, **where** **will** we **meet**?” (Answer: “We **’ll** meet at the park.”)  

#### **5. Variations**
- **Modal Verbs in Result Clause**: Instead of **will**, you can use **can**, **might**, or **should** for different meanings.  
  - Example: “If you **study**, you **can** pass.” (Ability.)  
  - Example: “If it **rains**, we **might** stay home.” (Possibility.)  
  - Example: “If you **feel** sick, you **should** rest.” (Advice.)  
- **Unless**: Means “if not,” replacing the if clause.  
  - Example: “**Unless** you **study**, you **’ll** fail.” (Same as “If you **don’t** study, you **’ll** fail.”)  
- **Other Conjunctions**: Words like **as long as**, **provided that**, or **in case** can replace **if** for specific conditions.  
  - Example: “**As long as** it **doesn’t** rain, I **’ll** go.” (Condition: no rain.)  
  - Example: “**In case** I **forget**, I **’ll** write it down.” (Preparation for possibility.)  

#### **6. Combining with Other Concepts**
The first conditional works with **countable/uncountable nouns**, **quantifiers**, **modal verbs**, **adverbs of frequency**, **comparatives/superlatives**, **possessives**, **demonstratives**, **conjunctions**, **prepositions**, **adjectives**, **present perfect**, **simple past**, and **future continuous**.  
- Simple Present: “If **my** friend **eats** **a few** **tasty** apples, she **’ll** be happy **tomorrow**.” (My = possessive, a few = quantifier, tasty = adjective, tomorrow = adverb.)  
- Future Continuous: “If **this** team **wins**, they **’ll be** celebrating **all night**.” (This = demonstrative, ’ll be = future continuous, all night = time expression.)  
- Present Perfect: “If you **’ve** finished **your** work, you **’ll** relax **later**.” (Your = possessive, ’ve = present perfect, later = adverb.)  
- Modal Verbs: “If **that** plan **works**, we **can** have **the best** party **and** **more** fun.” (That = demonstrative, can = modal, the best = superlative, and = conjunction, more = quantifier.)  
- Countable/Uncountable: “If I **drink** **some** coffee, I **’ll** feel **better** **in** the morning.” (Some = quantifier, better = comparative, in = preposition.)  

**Time Words**: Words like **tomorrow**, **later**, **tonight**, **next week**, or **soon** often signal the future in the result clause.  
- Example: “If I **study**, I **’ll** pass **tomorrow**.”

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (first conditional markers and related words) for everyday conversations:  
1. **If** (condition conjunction)  
   - Example: “**If** it **rains**, I **’ll** stay.”  
2. **Unless** (if not, conjunction)  
   - Example: “**Unless** you **call**, I **’ll** leave.”  
3. **Might** (modal for possibility)  
   - Example: “If I **go**, I **might** see you.”  
4. **Hurry** (move or act quickly, verb)  
   - Example: “If you **don’t** **hurry**, you **’ll** be late.”  
5. **Soon** (in the near future, adverb)  
   - Example: “If I **finish**, I **’ll** call **soon**.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: These words are great for discussing plans and possibilities. Notice them in texts or posts, like “If I **finish**, I **’ll** text you **soon**” or “**Unless** you **hurry**, we **’ll** miss it.” Try saying one aloud, like “If I **study**, I **’ll** pass,” to practice.

---

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with the first conditional, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “If” sounds like /ɪf/ (like “if” in “lift”).  
  - “Unless” sounds like /ənˈles/ (stress on “LESS”).  
  - “Might” sounds like /maɪt/ (like “bite” with “m”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “If, if, if.”  
- **Stress for Condition and Result**: Stress the verb in the **if clause** to highlight the condition and the verb in the **result clause** to emphasize the outcome.  
  - Example: “If it **RAINS**, I **’LL STAY** home!” (Stress “rains” and “’ll stay”.)  
  - Example: “If you **STUDY**, you **’LL PASS**!” (Stress “study” and “’ll pass”.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using the first conditional when planning or advising, like “If you **come**, I **’ll** cook” when texting or “If you **don’t** **hurry**, we **’ll** miss the bus” when rushing.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for conditionals (e.g., “If I **win**, I **’ll** celebrate” or “If you **try**, you **might** like it”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “If I **finish** early, I **’ll** call you **soon**.”  
- Stress the key words: “If I **FINISH** early, I **’LL CALL** you **SOON**.”  
- Try it like you’re making a plan with a friend.

### **Modern Examples**
The first conditional is common in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “If I **find** **some** coffee, I **’ll** be **happier** **soon** ☕” (some = quantifier, happier = comparative, soon = adverb).  
- Text to a friend: “If you **don’t** **hurry**, we **’ll** miss **that** bus **and** **the best** seats 🚌” (that = demonstrative, and = conjunction, the best = superlative).  
- Tweet: “If **my** team **wins**, we **’ll be** celebrating **all night** 🏆” (my = possessive, ’ll be = future continuous, all night = time expression).  
- YouTube comment: “If I **’ve** saved **enough**, I **’ll** buy **this** phone **next week** 📱” (’ve = present perfect, this = demonstrative, next week = time expression).  

These examples show how the first conditional makes plans and possibilities clear in modern, casual communication.

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Use **If + simple present, will + base verb**: “If it **rains**, I **’ll** stay.”  
  - Uses: Real possibilities (“If I **study**, I **’ll** pass”), plans (“If I **finish**, I **’ll** meet you”), warnings (“If you **don’t** **hurry**, you **’ll** be late”), offers (“If you **need**, I **’ll** help”).  
  - Negatives: **don’t/doesn’t** in if clause (“If I **don’t** go”), **won’t** in result (“I **won’t** stay”).  
  - Questions: **Will** + subject + base verb (“If it **rains**, **will** you **stay**?”).  
  - Variations: Use **can**, **might**, **should** (“If you **try**, you **might** win”), or **unless** (“**Unless** you **study**, you **’ll** fail”).  
  - Combine with quantifiers, possessives, etc.: “If **my** friend **eats** **a few** **tasty** apples, she **’ll** be **happier** **tomorrow**.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **if, unless, might, hurry, soon** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce “if/unless” clearly, stress condition and result verbs, and use in casual settings like texts or chats.
