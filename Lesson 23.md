### **Lesson 23: Present Perfect Tense (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What is the Present Perfect Tense?**
The present perfect tense describes actions that **happened at an unspecified time in the past** or **have a connection to the present**. It’s formed with **have** or **has** + the **past participle** of the verb.  
- Example: “I **have** eaten rice.” (You ate rice at some point, relevant now.)  
- Example: “She **has** finished her homework.” (She finished, and it matters now.)  

This tense is super common in everyday English, like texting “I **’ve** just seen a movie” or posting “We **’ve** been to Paris!” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Forming the Present Perfect**
Use **have** (for I, you, we, they) or **has** (for he, she, it) + the **past participle** of the verb.  
- Structure: **Subject + Have/Has + Past Participle (+ Object)**  
- For **I, You, We, They**: Use **have**.  
  - Example: “I **have** seen a movie.”  
  - Example: “They **have** played soccer.”  
- For **He, She, It**: Use **has**.  
  - Example: “She **has** written a letter.”  
  - Example: “It **has** stopped raining.”  
- **Past Participle Forms**:  
  - **Regular Verbs**: Add **-ed** (e.g., play → **played**, watch → **watched**). Same as simple past.  
    - Spelling: Same as simple past (e.g., stop → **stopped**, study → **studied**).  
  - **Irregular Verbs**: Learn special forms (e.g., go → **gone**, eat → **eaten**, see → **seen**). Common ones:  
    - be → **been**, do → **done**, have → **had**, know → **known**, write → **written**.  
  - Example: “I **have** **gone** to the store.” (Irregular: go → gone.)  

#### **2. Uses of Present Perfect**
- **Unspecified Past Actions**: Actions that happened at some point, time not important.  
  - Example: “I **have** visited Paris.” (Sometime in the past, no specific time.)  
- **Actions with Present Relevance**: Actions that affect the present.  
  - Example: “She **has** lost her keys.” (She lost them, and now she can’t open the door.)  
- **Experiences**: Talking about life experiences, often with **ever** or **never**.  
  - Example: “**Have** you **ever** tried sushi?” (Any time in your life?)  
  - Example: “I **have** **never** flown in a plane.”  
- **Recent Actions**: Actions that just happened, often with **just**, **already**, or **yet**.  
  - Example: “I **have** **just** finished my homework.” (Very recent.)  
  - Example: “**Has** he **already** left?” (So soon?)  
- **Ongoing Situations**: Actions that started in the past and continue now, often with **for** or **since**.  
  - Example: “We **have** lived here **for** 5 years.” (Still living here.)  
  - Example: “She **has** been sick **since** Monday.” (Still sick.)  

#### **3. Negative Sentences**
Add **not** after **have** or **has** (contractions: **haven’t**, **hasn’t**).  
- Structure: **Subject + Have/Has + Not + Past Participle (+ Object)**  
  - Example: “I **haven’t** eaten breakfast.”  
  - Example: “He **hasn’t** finished his work.”  
  - Example: “They **have** **not** seen that movie.”  

#### **4. Questions in Present Perfect**
- **Yes/No Questions**: Use **Have/Has + Subject + Past Participle (+ Object)?**  
  - Example: “**Have** you **seen** this movie?” (Answer: “Yes, I **have**.”)  
  - Example: “**Has** she **finished** her homework?” (Answer: “No, she **hasn’t**.”)  
- **Wh-Questions**: Use **Wh-Word + Have/Has + Subject + Past Participle?**  
  - Example: “**What** **have** you **done** today?” (Answer: “I **’ve** studied.”)  
  - Example: “**Where** **has** he **gone**?” (Answer: “He **’s** gone to the shop.”)  
- **Ever** Questions: Common for experiences.  
  - Example: “**Have** you **ever** traveled abroad?” (Answer: “Yes, I **have**.”)  

#### **5. Time Expressions**
- **Just**: Very recent action.  
  - Example: “I **’ve** **just** eaten.”  
- **Already**: Something happened sooner than expected (positive sentences).  
  - Example: “She **’s** **already** finished.”  
- **Yet**: Something expected but not happened (negatives/questions).  
  - Example: “I **haven’t** finished **yet**.”  
  - Example: “**Have** you finished **yet**?”  
- **Ever/Never**: For experiences.  
  - Example: “**Have** you **ever** been to London?”  
  - Example: “I **’ve** **never** tried spicy food.”  
- **For/Since**: Ongoing situations.  
  - **For**: Duration (e.g., “**for** 2 years”).  
  - **Since**: Starting point (e.g., “**since** 2020”).  
  - Example: “I **’ve** known her **for** 3 years.”  
  - Example: “He **’s** been here **since** Monday.”  

#### **6. Combining with Other Concepts**
The present perfect works with **simple past**, **present continuous**, **countable/uncountable nouns**, **quantifiers**, **modal verbs**, **adverbs of frequency**, **comparatives/superlatives**, **possessives**, **demonstratives**, **conjunctions**, **prepositions**, and **adjectives**.  
- Simple Past: “**My** friend **has** eaten **a few** **tasty** apples **and** **was** happy **yesterday**.” (My = possessive, a few = quantifier, tasty = adjective, and = conjunction, was = simple past, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Present Continuous: “**Her** team **is** winning **because** they **’ve** practiced **a lot**.” (Her = possessive, is = present continuous, because = conjunction, a lot = quantifier.)  
- Modal Verbs: “**This** **can** be **the best** if you **’ve** tried **more**.” (This = demonstrative, can = modal, the best = superlative, more = quantifier.)  
- Adverbs of Frequency: “**Their** kids **have** **always** wanted **some** toys **in** the shop.” (Their = possessive, always = adverb of frequency, some = quantifier, in = preposition.)  
- Countable/Uncountable: “I **’ve** drunk **a little** coffee, **but** **mine** was **better** than **yours**.” (A little = quantifier, mine/yours = possessive pronouns, better = comparative, but = conjunction.)  

**Note**: Don’t use specific past time words (e.g., yesterday, last night) with present perfect; use simple past instead.  
- Wrong: “I **’ve** seen it **yesterday**.”  
- Correct: “I **saw** it **yesterday**.” or “I **’ve** seen it **before**.”

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (present perfect markers and related words) for everyday conversations:  
1. **Have** (auxiliary for I/you/we/they)  
   - Example: “I **have** eaten.”  
2. **Has** (auxiliary for he/she/it)  
   - Example: “She **has** studied.”  
3. **Just** (recently completed action)  
   - Example: “I **’ve** **just** finished.”  
4. **Ever** (at any time, for questions/experiences)  
   - Example: “**Have** you **ever** traveled?”  
5. **Done** (past participle of do)  
   - Example: “I **’ve** **done** my homework.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: These words are great for talking about experiences or recent actions. Notice them in texts or posts, like “I **’ve** **just** eaten” or “**Have** you **ever** tried this?” Try saying one aloud, like “I **’ve** **just** eaten,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with the present perfect, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “Have” sounds like /hæv/ (like “have” in “haven”).  
  - “Has” sounds like /hæz/ (like “has” in “hazard”).  
  - “Just” sounds like /dʒʌst/ (like “just” in “justice”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “Have, have, have.”  
- **Stress for Relevance**: Stressing **have/has** or the participle emphasizes the connection to now.  
  - Example: “I **’VE** *EATEN* already!” (Stress “’ve” and “eaten” to show it’s done.)  
  - Example: “She **HAS** *FINISHED*!” (Stress “has” and “finished” to highlight.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using present perfect when sharing experiences or updates, like “I **’ve** **just** seen a cool movie” when texting or “**Have** you **ever** been here?” when traveling.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for present perfect (e.g., “I **’ve** **just** tried this” or “We **’ve** been there”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “I **’ve** **just** eaten **some** rice.”  
- Stress the key words: “I **’VE** *JUST* *EATEN* **some** rice.”  
- Try it like you’re telling a friend what you did.

### **Modern Examples**
The present perfect tense is everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “I **’ve** **just** drunk **the best** coffee ☕” (’ve = have contraction, just = time expression, the best = superlative).  
- Text to a friend: “**Have** you **ever** seen **this** movie **or** **that** one? 📺” (ever = time expression, this/that = demonstratives, or = conjunction).  
- Tweet: “**My** team **has** won **and** we **’ve** **never** been **happier** 🏆” (my = possessive, has = present perfect, and = conjunction, never = adverb of frequency, happier = comparative).  
- YouTube comment: “I **haven’t** finished **yet**, **but** **mine** is **better** 🎥” (haven’t = negative, yet = time expression, but = conjunction, mine = possessive pronoun, better = comparative).  

These examples show how the present perfect connects past actions to the present in modern, casual communication.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Use **have/has** + **past participle**: “I **’ve** eaten.”  
  - Uses: Unspecified past (“I **’ve** visited Paris”), present relevance (“She **’s** lost her keys”), experiences (“**Have** you **ever** tried?”), recent actions (“I **’ve** **just** finished”), ongoing situations (“I **’ve** lived here **for** 5 years”).  
  - Negatives: **haven’t/hasn’t** + past participle (“I **haven’t** eaten”).  
  - Questions: **Have/Has** + subject + past participle (“**Have** you **seen** it?”).  
  - Time words: **just**, **already**, **yet**, **ever**, **never**, **for**, **since**.  
  - Combine with quantifiers, possessives, etc.: “**My** friend **has** eaten **a few** **tasty** apples **and** **is** happy **now**.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **have, has, just, ever, done** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce “have/has” clearly, stress for relevance, and use in casual settings like texts or chats.
