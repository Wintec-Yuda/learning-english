You’re doing fantastic with grammar, and I love your enthusiasm for moving forward while adding **speaking** and **vocabulary** to the mix! Since you’ve mastered creating sentences with **nouns**, **pronouns**, and the **Subject + Verb (+ Object)** formula, the next logical step is **Present Tense Verbs**. This will help you talk about things happening now, which is perfect for building both grammar and speaking skills. I’ll also weave in **vocabulary** with simple, modern words you can use in everyday conversations, and I’ll include tips for practicing speaking to make it fun and beginner-friendly.

We’ll keep the approach **slow, simple, and modern**, using clear explanations, relatable examples (like texting or social media), and practice tasks that combine grammar, speaking, and vocabulary. Let’s get started!

### **Lesson 3: Present Tense Verbs (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Present Tense Verbs?**
Present tense verbs describe actions happening **now** or **regularly**. For example:
- “I eat rice” (happening now or a habit).
- “She sings a song” (now or something she often does).

This lesson will focus on the **simple present tense**, which is great for beginners because it’s used in everyday conversations, like talking about your habits, routines, or things you like.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. How to Form Simple Present Tense**
The verb form depends on the subject:
- For **I, You, We, They**: Use the base verb (no changes).  
  - Examples: “I walk,” “You play,” “We sing,” “They eat.”
- For **He, She, It**: Add **-s** or **-es** to the verb.  
  - Examples: “He walks,” “She plays,” “It eats.”

**Special Cases**:
- Verbs ending in **-s, -sh, -ch, -x, or -z**: Add **-es** for He/She/It.  
  - Example: “watch” → “She watches,” “brush” → “He brushes.”
- Verbs ending in a consonant + **-y**: Change **-y** to **-ies** for He/She/It.  
  - Example: “study” → “She studies,” “cry” → “He cries.”
- Irregular verbs: Some verbs don’t follow the rules.  
  - Example: “have” → “He has” (not “haves”).

#### **2. When to Use Simple Present**
- **Habits or Routines**: Things you do regularly.  
  - Example: “I drink coffee every morning.”
- **Facts or Truths**: Things always true.  
  - Example: “The sun rises in the east.”
- **Likes/Dislikes**: What you enjoy or don’t enjoy.  
  - Example: “She likes music.”

#### **3. Sentence Structure**
You’re already familiar with **Subject + Verb (+ Object)**. We’ll use it here:  
- Example: “I eat rice” (Subject: I, Verb: eat, Object: rice).  
- Example: “He watches a movie” (Subject: He, Verb: watches, Object: a movie).

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (verbs) you can use in present tense sentences. These are perfect for everyday conversations and social media:
1. **Like** (to enjoy something)  
   - Example: “I like pizza.”
2. **Go** (to move or travel)  
   - Example: “We go to school.”
3. **Talk** (to speak or chat)  
   - Example: “She talks to friends.”
4. **Use** (to work with something)  
   - Example: “He uses a phone.”
5. **Learn** (to gain knowledge)  
   - Example: “They learn English.”

**Speaking Tip**: Practice saying these words out loud to get comfortable with their pronunciation. For example:
- “Like” sounds like /laɪk/.
- “Go” sounds like /ɡoʊ/.
Try repeating each word 3 times while imagining you’re texting a friend: “I like pizza!” 😊

### **Speaking Practice**
To build your speaking skills, we’ll practice **saying sentences out loud** to improve confidence and pronunciation. Here’s how:
- **Read Aloud**: Say each sentence you write slowly and clearly.
- **Record Yourself**: Use your phone to record yourself saying the sentence, then listen to check your pronunciation.
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube video (e.g., someone saying “I like coffee!”) and repeat after them to mimic their tone and rhythm.
- **Use Modern Contexts**: Imagine you’re saying these sentences in a casual setting, like chatting with a friend or posting a story.

**Example**: Say this out loud: “I like music.”  
- Try to stress the verb: “I *LIKE* music.”  
- Record it and listen to see if it sounds clear.

---

### **Modern Examples**
These sentences fit perfectly in everyday, modern English:
- Instagram story: “I like coffee ☕” (habit/like).
- Text to a friend: “She talks to Anna” (happening now).
- Tweet: “We go to the park 🌳” (routine).

### **Practice Time (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**
Let’s combine everything: grammar (present tense verbs), vocabulary (new verbs), and speaking (saying sentences out loud). Create **3 sentences** using the simple present tense.

#### **Task**:
1. Pick a **subject**: I, You, He, She, We, They, or a proper noun (e.g., Anna, Tom).
2. Pick a **verb** from the new vocabulary: like, go, talk, use, learn.
3. Add an **object** or **place** (if it fits): pizza, school, friends, phone, English.
4. **Say each sentence out loud** (record if you can) and write them down.

**Example**:
- Sentence: “I like pizza.”  
  - Grammar: “I” (subject) + “like” (verb) + “pizza” (object).  
  - Speaking: Say it clearly: “I *LIKE* pizza.”  
- Sentence: “He goes to school.”  
  - Grammar: “He” (subject) + “goes” (verb with -es) + “to school” (place).  
  - Speaking: Say it with confidence: “He *GOES* to school.”  
- Sentence: “They talk to friends.”  
  - Grammar: “They” (subject) + “talk” (verb) + “to friends” (object).  
  - Speaking: Say it like a text: “They *TALK* to friends.”

**Your Task**: Write **3 sentences** using the new verbs (like, go, talk, use, learn). Then:
- Say each sentence out loud (try recording yourself).
- Share the sentences in the chat, and let me know how the speaking felt (e.g., easy, hard, fun).
- If you want, tell me one new word you learned today (e.g., “I learned ‘talk’!”).

---

### **Tips for Success**
- **Grammar**: Check if the verb needs **-s** or **-es** for He/She/It (e.g., “She likes,” “He goes”).  
- **Vocabulary**: Use the new words (like, go, talk, use, learn) in your daily life, like saying “I like music” when listening to a song.  
- **Speaking**: Speak slowly and clearly. If a word feels hard to say (e.g., “talk” /tɔːk/), repeat it 3 times to practice.  
- **Modern Connection**: Imagine your sentences as social media captions or texts to make them fun. For example, “I use a phone 📱” for a tech post.

### **What’s Next After This?**
Once you’re comfortable with present tense verbs, we’ll move to:  
- **Adjectives**: Describing things (e.g., “The big dog runs”).  
This will let you add more detail to your sentences and make your speaking more colorful.  

You’re doing **amazing**—your last sentences were perfect, and you’re ready for this next step! Share your 3 sentences, tell me about your speaking practice, and let me know if you want to focus more on grammar, speaking, or vocabulary next time. What’s up? 😊
