### What is a Sentence?  
A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It tells you:  
- **Who/What** (Subject)  
- **Does/Is** (Verb)  

**Examples**:  
- "She dances." (Who? *She* / Does what? *dances*)  
- "The cat sleeps." (What? *The cat* / Does what? *sleeps*)

### Key Concepts (Super Simple)  
1. **Subjects**  
   - The "who/what" the sentence is about.  
   - Can be a noun (*dog*, *Maria*) or pronoun (*they*, *it*).  
   - Example: "*Pizza* is delicious." (*Pizza* = subject)  

2. **Verbs**  
   - The action or state of being (e.g., *run*, *is*, *love*).  
   - Example: "He *eats* rice." (*eats* = action verb)  

3. **Basic Sentence Structure**  
   - **Subject + Verb (+ Object)**:  
     - "I sleep." (No object needed)  
     - "She buys *shoes*." (*shoes* = object)

### Modern Examples  
- Tweet: "You rock! ðŸ¤˜" (*You* = subject, *rock* = verb)
