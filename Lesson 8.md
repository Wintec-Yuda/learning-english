### **Lesson 8: Simple Present Negative Sentences (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Simple Present Negative Sentences?**
Negative sentences in the simple present tense are used to say what **doesn’t happen**, what **you don’t do**, or what **isn’t true**. They’re perfect for expressing dislikes, habits you avoid, or current states.  
- Example: “I **don’t** like tea.” (Says you don’t enjoy tea.)  
- Example: “She **isn’t** at school.” (Says where she is not.)  

These are super common in everyday English, like texting “I don’t eat meat” or posting “It isn’t cool” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Negatives with Action Verbs (e.g., like, eat, go)**
To make a negative sentence with action verbs, use **do not** (or **don’t**) or **does not** (or **doesn’t**) + the **base verb**.  
- Structure: **Subject + Do/Does + Not + Base Verb (+ Object)**  
- For **I, You, We, They**: Use **don’t** + base verb.  
  - Example: “I **don’t** like tea.” (Base verb: like, no -s.)  
  - Example: “They **don’t** play games.”  
- For **He, She, It**: Use **doesn’t** + base verb.  
  - Example: “She **doesn’t** eat meat.” (Base verb: eat, no -s.)  
  - Example: “He **doesn’t** go to the park.”  
- **Note**: Always use the **base verb** after **don’t** or **doesn’t** (no “-s” or “-es,” even for He/She/It).  
  - Correct: “He **doesn’t** like music.” (Not “doesn’t likes.”)

#### **2. Negatives with “To Be” Verbs (am, is, are)**
For “to be” verbs, add **not** after **am**, **is**, or **are** (or use contractions: **aren’t**, **isn’t**).  
- Structure: **Subject + Am/Is/Are + Not + Adjective/Noun**  
- For **I**: Use **am not** (no common contraction).  
  - Example: “I **am not** happy.”  
- For **He, She, It**: Use **is not** (or **isn’t**).  
  - Example: “She **isn’t** tall.”  
  - Example: “It **isn’t** a big dog.”  
- For **You, We, They**: Use **are not** (or **aren’t**).  
  - Example: “We **aren’t** at school.”  
  - Example: “You **aren’t** tired.”  

#### **3. Combining with Prepositions, Adjectives, and Adverbs**
Negatives work well with **prepositions** (in, on, at), **adjectives** (big, happy), and **adverbs** (quickly, always) from earlier lessons.  
- Example: “I **don’t** live **in** a **big** city.” (Preposition: in, adjective: big.)  
- Example: “He **doesn’t** sing **well**.” (Adverb: well.)  
- Example: “She **isn’t** **at** home **now**.” (Preposition: at, adverb: now.)  

#### **4. Negatives in Questions**
You can use negatives in questions (from Lesson 5) to confirm or clarify.  
- Example: “**Don’t** you like coffee?” (Expecting a yes/no answer.)  
  - Answer: “No, I **don’t** like coffee.”  
- Example: “**Isn’t** she **at** school?” (Preposition: at.)  
  - Answer: “No, she **isn’t** at school.”  
- Example: “**Why** **doesn’t** he play **on** Monday?” (Preposition: on.)  
  - Answer: “He **doesn’t** play **on** Monday because he works.”

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (related to negatives and useful verbs) for everyday conversations:  
1. **Don’t** (do not, for I/You/We/They)  
   - Example: “I **don’t** eat sugar.”  
2. **Doesn’t** (does not, for He/She/It)  
   - Example: “She **doesn’t** watch TV.”  
3. **Know** (to understand or be aware)  
   - Example: “I **don’t** know the answer.”  
4. **Want** (to desire something)  
   - Example: “He **doesn’t** want coffee.”  
5. **Need** (to require something)  
   - Example: “We **don’t** need a big car.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: These words are super common in casual English. Try noticing them in conversations or posts, like “I don’t know” in a text or “She doesn’t want that” on social media. Say one aloud, like “I don’t like rain,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with negative sentences, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “Don’t” sounds like /doʊnt/ (like “don’t” in “donut”).  
  - “Doesn’t” sounds like /ˈdʌz.ənt/ (stress on “DUZ”).  
  - “Know” sounds like /noʊ/ (like “no”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “Don’t, don’t, don’t.”  
- **Stress the Negative for Emphasis**: In English, stressing “don’t” or “doesn’t” shows conviction.  
  - Example: “I *DON’T* like tea!” (Stress “don’t” to sound firm.)  
  - Example: “She *ISN’T* at home!” (Stress “isn’t” to clarify.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try negatives in real-life situations, like “I don’t want soda” when ordering or “I’m not tired” when chatting.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for negatives (e.g., “I don’t like it” or “He isn’t here”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “I **don’t** like tea.”  
- Stress the negative: “I *DON’T* like tea.”  
- Try it like you’re politely refusing a drink.

### **Modern Examples**
Negative sentences are everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “I **don’t** eat meat 🍔” (don’t = negative, eat = action verb).  
- Text to a friend: “She **isn’t** **at** the mall 🛍️” (isn’t = negative, at = preposition).  
- Tweet: “He **doesn’t** know the song 🎶” (doesn’t = negative, know = verb).  
- YouTube comment: “I **don’t** want a **big** phone 📱” (don’t = negative, big = adjective).  

These examples show how negatives make your sentences clear and relatable in modern, casual communication.

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Use **don’t** (I/You/We/They) or **doesn’t** (He/She/It) + base verb for action verbs: “I **don’t** like,” “She **doesn’t** eat.”  
  - Use **am not**, **is not** (isn’t), **are not** (aren’t) for “to be”: “I **am not** happy,” “They **aren’t** at home.”  
  - Combine with prepositions, adjectives, adverbs: “I **don’t** live **in** a **big** city **now**.”  
  - Use in questions: “**Don’t** you like it?” “**Isn’t** she happy?”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **don’t, doesn’t, know, want, need** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce negatives clearly, stress “don’t” or “doesn’t” for emphasis, and use them in casual settings like texts or chats.
