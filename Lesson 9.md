# Articles Material

## What are Articles?

Articles (**a**, **an**, **the**) come before nouns to show if you’re talking about something **general** (a/an) or **specific** (the).

- Example: “I have **a** cat.” (General, any cat.)
- Example: “**The** cat is cute.” (Specific cat.)

## Grammar Rules

1. **Indefinite Articles (A/An)**:
   - For general, **countable** nouns (first mention).
   - **A**: Before consonant sounds (e.g., “**A** cat,” “**A** book”).
   - **An**: Before vowel sounds (e.g., “**An** apple,” “**An** engineer”).
   - Not with uncountable nouns (e.g., “I drink water,” not “**a** water”).
2. **Definite Article (The)**:
   - For **specific** nouns (countable or uncountable): “**The** cat,” “**The** music.”
   - For unique things: “**The** sun,” “**The** moon.”
3. **No Article (Zero Article)**:
   - For general uncountable or plural nouns: “I like music,” “Cats are cute.”
4. **With Other Concepts**:
   - Example: “I eat **a** **tasty** apple **in** the kitchen.” (With adjective, preposition.)
   - Questions: “Do you have **a** phone?” “Is **the** book **on** the table?”
   - Negatives: “I **don’t** have **a** car.” “**The** dog **isn’t** big.”

## Vocabulary

- **A**: For consonant sounds (e.g., “I want **a** coffee”).
- **An**: For vowel sounds (e.g., “She eats **an** orange”).
- **The**: For specific things (e.g., “**The** sun is bright”).
- **House**: A place to live (e.g., “I live in **a** house”).
- **Food**: Something to eat (e.g., “I like **the** food”).

## Speaking Tips

- Pronounce clearly: “A” (/ə/), “An” (/ən/), “The” (/ðə/ or /ði/).
- Keep articles light: “I have **a** phone.” (Stress “phone.”)
- Use in context: Say “I want **a** tea” when ordering.
- Imitate: Repeat after videos (e.g., “I got **a** new phone”).
