### **Lesson 19: Adverbs of Frequency (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Adverbs of Frequency?**
Adverbs of frequency describe **how often** an action happens, ranging from **never** (0%) to **always** (100%). They add detail to your sentences, showing habits, routines, or tendencies.  
- Example: “I **always** drink coffee.” (Every time, 100%.)  
- Example: “She **sometimes** plays games.” (Occasionally, maybe 50%.)  

These adverbs are super common in everyday English, like texting “I **usually** sleep late” or posting “I **never** miss a party!” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Common Adverbs of Frequency**
Here are the most common adverbs, with their approximate frequency:  
- **Always**: 100% (every time).  
  - Example: “I **always** eat breakfast.”  
- **Usually**: ~80% (most of the time).  
  - Example: “She **usually** walks to school.”  
- **Often**: ~60% (more than half the time).  
  - Example: “They **often** watch movies.”  
- **Sometimes**: ~40% (less than half the time).  
  - Example: “He **sometimes** forgets his phone.”  
- **Rarely**: ~20% (not often).  
  - Example: “I **rarely** eat spicy food.”  
- **Never**: 0% (not at all).  
  - Example: “We **never** go to the gym.”  

#### **2. Position in Sentences**
Adverbs of frequency usually go **before the main verb** but **after the verb “to be”** or **modal verbs**.  
- **Before Main Verbs** (except “to be”):  
  - Structure: **Subject + Adverb + Main Verb (+ Object)**  
  - Example: “I **always** eat rice.” (Adverb before “eat.”)  
  - Example: “She **often** sings songs.” (Adverb before “sing.”)  
- **After “To Be”**:  
  - Structure: **Subject + Am/Is/Are + Adverb (+ Adjective/Noun/Preposition)**  
  - Example: “He **is** **never** late.” (Adverb after “is.”)  
  - Example: “We **are** **usually** at home.” (Adverb after “are.”)  
- **After Modal Verbs**:  
  - Structure: **Subject + Modal (can/must/should) + Adverb + Base Verb**  
  - Example: “I **can** **always** help you.” (Adverb after “can.”)  
  - Example: “You **should** **never** give up.” (Adverb after “should.”)  
- **At the Start or End** (less common, for emphasis):  
  - Example: “**Sometimes** I eat late.” (Start, emphasis.)  
  - Example: “I eat late **sometimes**.” (End, emphasis.)  

#### **3. Negative Sentences**
Adverbs of frequency work in negatives, often with **not** to adjust meaning.  
- Example: “I **don’t** **often** go to parties.” (Not frequently.)  
- Example: “She **isn’t** **always** happy.” (Not every time.)  
- **Note**: **Never** already means “not at all,” so no extra “not” is needed.  
  - Correct: “I **never** eat meat.” (Not “I don’t never eat meat.”)  

#### **4. Questions with Adverbs of Frequency**
Adverbs of frequency can be used in questions to ask about habits or routines.  
- **Yes/No Questions**:  
  - Example: “**Do** you **often** watch TV?” (Answer: “Yes, I **do**.”)  
  - Example: “**Are** you **always** busy?” (Answer: “No, I **’m not**.”)  
- **Wh- Questions**:  
  - Example: “**How often** do you **play** games?” (Answer: “I **sometimes** play games.”)  
  - Example: “**When** are you **usually** free?” (Answer: “I **’m** **usually** free at night.”)  
- **Note**: **How often** is a special question phrase for frequency.  
  - Example: “**How often** do you eat pizza?” → “**Twice** a week.” or “**Often**.”  

#### **5. Combining with Other Concepts**
Adverbs of frequency work with **simple present**, **past**, **future**, **present continuous**, **countable/uncountable nouns**, **quantifiers**, **modal verbs**, **adjectives**, **prepositions**, **demonstratives**, **possessives**, and **conjunctions**.  
- Present: “**My** friend **always** eats **a lot of** rice **in** the kitchen.” (My = possessive, a lot of = quantifier, in = preposition.)  
- Past: “**This** cat **rarely** slept **on** the bed **yesterday**.” (This = demonstrative, on = preposition, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Future: “**Those** kids **will** **often** play **tomorrow**.” (Those = demonstrative, will = future, tomorrow = adverb.)  
- Present Continuous: “**Her** team **is** **usually** practicing **now**.” (Her = possessive, now = adverb.)  
- Modal Verbs: “I **can** **never** eat **too** **many** snacks.” (Can = modal, many = quantifier, too = adverb.)  
- Negative: “**These** books **aren’t** **often** interesting **but** useful.” (These = demonstrative, but = conjunction.)  
- Question: “**Should** I **always** buy **some** fruit **or** **a few** snacks?” (Should = modal, some/a few = quantifiers, or = conjunction.)  

#### **6. Adverbs of Frequency with Countable/Uncountable Nouns**
- Countable: Use with **many**, **a few**, numbers.  
  - Example: “I **often** buy **a few** apples.”  
- Uncountable: Use with **some**, **much**, **a little**.  
  - Example: “She **rarely** drinks **much** coffee.”

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (adverbs of frequency and related words) for everyday conversations:  
1. **Always** (every time, 100%)  
   - Example: “I **always** drink coffee.”  
2. **Usually** (most of the time, ~80%)  
   - Example: “She **usually** walks.”  
3. **Sometimes** (occasionally, ~40%)  
   - Example: “He **sometimes** plays.”  
4. **Free** (not busy, adjective)  
   - Example: “I **’m** **often** free.”  
5. **Twice** (two times, frequency expression)  
   - Example: “I eat pizza **twice** a week.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: Adverbs of frequency are great for describing routines. Notice them in texts or posts, like “I **always** check my phone” or “I **rarely** sleep early.” Try saying one aloud, like “I **usually** eat rice,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with adverbs of frequency, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “Always” sounds like /ˈɔːl.weɪz/ (stress on “ALL”).  
  - “Usually” sounds like /ˈjuː.ʒu.əl.i/ (stress on “YOU”).  
  - “Sometimes” sounds like /ˈsʌm.taɪmz/ (stress on “SOME”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “Always, always, always.”  
- **Stress Adverbs for Emphasis**: Stressing the adverb highlights the frequency.  
  - Example: “I *ALWAYS* drink coffee!” (Stress “always” to show every time.)  
  - Example: “I *NEVER* go there!” (Stress “never” to emphasize.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using frequency adverbs when talking about habits, like “I **usually** sleep late” when texting or “I **sometimes** watch movies” when chatting.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for frequency adverbs (e.g., “I **always** do this” or “I **sometimes** forget”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “I **always** eat rice **and** I **sometimes** drink tea.”  
- Stress the adverbs: “I *ALWAYS* eat rice and I *SOMETIMES* drink tea.”  
- Try it like you’re telling a friend about your habits.

### **Modern Examples**
Adverbs of frequency are everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “I **always** drink **some** coffee **in** the morning ☕” (always = adverb, some = quantifier, in = preposition).  
- Text to a friend: “**Do** you **often** go **to** the mall **or** **rarely**?” (often/rarely = adverbs, to = preposition, or = conjunction).  
- Tweet: “**This** **is** **usually** fun **but** I **never** win 🐾” (this = demonstrative, usually/never = adverbs, but = conjunction).  
- YouTube comment: “I **’m** **sometimes** watching **these** videos **now** 🎥” (’m = present continuous, sometimes = adverb, these = demonstrative, now = adverb).  

These examples show how adverbs of frequency add detail and personality to modern, casual communication.

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Use **always**, **usually**, **often**, **sometimes**, **rarely**, **never** to show frequency.  
  - Position: **Before** main verbs (“I **always** eat”), **after** “to be” (“She **is** **never** late”), **after** modals (“I **can** **often** help”).  
  - Negatives: Use with **not** (“I **don’t** **often** go”) or **never** alone (“I **never** go”).  
  - Questions: “**Do** you **often** play?” or “**How often** do you eat?”  
  - Combine with tenses, quantifiers, etc.: “**My** friend **always** eats **a few** **tasty** apples **in** the kitchen **now**.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **always, usually, sometimes, free, twice** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce adverbs clearly, stress them for emphasis, and use in casual settings like texts or chats.
