### **Lesson 7: Prepositions (Grammar, Dân Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Prepositions?**
Prepositions are words that show the relationship between a noun (or pronoun) and other parts of a sentence. They often describe **where**, **when**, or **how** something happens.  
- Example: “I live **in** a house.” (In shows where I live.)  
- Example: “She plays **at** school.” (At shows where she plays.)  
- Example: “We meet **on** Monday.” (On shows when we meet.)  

Prepositions are super common in daily English and help you sound clear and natural when speaking or writing, like in a text saying, “I’m at the park!” or a post like, “Coffee in the morning ☕.”

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Types of Prepositions**
- **Prepositions of Place** (Where something is or happens):  
  - Examples: **in**, **on**, **at**, **under**, **next to**  
  - Sentence: “The book is **on** the table.” (On shows where the book is.)  
  - Sentence: “I study **at** school.” (At shows where I study.)  
- **Prepositions of Time** (When something happens):  
  - Examples: **in**, **on**, **at**, **before**, **after**  
  - Sentence: “We meet **on** Monday.” (On shows when we meet.)  
  - Sentence: “I wake up **at** 7.” (At shows the time.)  
- **Prepositions of Direction/Movement** (Where something is going):  
  - Examples: **to**, **into**, **from**  
  - Sentence: “She goes **to** the park.” (To shows where she’s going.)  

#### **2. Common Prepositions and Their Uses**
- **In**:  
  - Place: For larger areas or enclosed spaces (e.g., “I live **in** a city,” “The cat is **in** the box”).  
  - Time: For months, years, or parts of the day (e.g., “I study **in** the morning,” “She was born **in** July”).  
- **On**:  
  - Place: For surfaces or specific locations (e.g., “The phone is **on** the table,” “I live **on** Main Street”).  
  - Time: For days or dates (e.g., “We play **on** Saturday,” “I work **on** June 5”).  
- **At**:  
  - Place: For specific points or locations (e.g., “I’m **at** school,” “She waits **at** the bus stop”).  
  - Time: For exact times or events (e.g., “We meet **at** 3 p.m.,” “They sing **at** the party”).  
- **To**:  
  - Direction: Moving toward a place (e.g., “I go **to** the shop,” “He walks **to** school”).  
- **From**:  
  - Direction: Moving away or origin (e.g., “She comes **from** Japan,” “I walk **from** home”).  

#### **3. Combining Prepositions with Simple Present**
Prepositions work beautifully with the **simple present tense**, **adjectives**, and **adverbs** from earlier lessons to add detail.  
- Example: “I live **in** a **big** house.” (In = preposition, big = adjective.)  
- Example: “She sings **well** **at** school.” (Well = adverb, at = preposition.)  
- Example: “Do you go **to** the park **often**?” (To = preposition, often = adverb.)  

**Verb Reminder**:  
- For He/She/It, add **-s** or **-es** to action verbs (e.g., “She lives,” “He goes”).  
- For “to be,” use **am/is/are** (e.g., “I am **at** home,” “They are **in** the park”).  

#### **4. Prepositions in Questions**
Prepositions are common in **simple present questions** (from the last lesson).  
- Example: “Where do you live?” → “I live **in** a city.”  
- Example: “When does she play?” → “She plays **on** Saturday.”  
- Example: “Is he **at** school?” → “Yes, he **is** **at** school.”

### **Vocabulary (New Prepositions to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern prepositions** you can use in everyday conversations:  
1. **In** (for places or times)  
   - Example: “I study **in** the library.”  
2. **On** (for surfaces or days)  
   - Example: “We meet **on** Friday.”  
3. **At** (for specific places or times)  
   - Example: “She is **at** the shop.”  
4. **To** (for direction)  
   - Example: “I go **to** school.”  
5. **From** (for origin or starting point)  
   - Example: “He comes **from** Bali.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: These prepositions are used all the time in casual English. Try noticing them in texts or posts, like “I’m at the mall” or “See you on Monday!” You can also say one aloud, like “I’m in the room,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with prepositions, focus on pronunciation, flow, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “In” sounds like /ɪn/ (short and simple).  
  - “On” sounds like /ɒn/ (like “on” in “song”).  
  - “At” sounds like /æt/ (short, like “hat”).  
  - Say each preposition 3 times: “In, in, in.”  
- **Stress Prepositions Lightly**: In English, prepositions are usually unstressed, but you can emphasize them for clarity in questions.  
  - Example: “Are you **AT** the park?” (Light stress on “at” to ask clearly.)  
  - Example: “I live **IN** a city.” (Light stress on “in” to sound natural.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using prepositions when talking, like “I’m at home” when texting or “I study in the morning” when chatting about your routine.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for prepositions (e.g., “I’m in the car” or “Meet me at 5”). Repeat their sentences to mimic their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “I go **to** school.”  
- Keep “to” light and quick: “I go *to* school.”  
- Try it like you’re telling a friend your plans.

### **Modern Examples**
Prepositions are everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “Chilling **in** the park 🌳” (in = place).  
- Text to a friend: “Meet me **at** the cafe ☕” (at = place).  
- Tweet: “I go **to** the gym **on** Mondays 💪” (to = direction, on = time).  
- YouTube vlog: “I’m **from** Jakarta! 🇮🇩” (from = origin).  

These examples show how prepositions make your sentences clear and fit perfectly in modern, casual communication.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Prepositions show **where** (in, on, at), **when** (in, on, at), or **direction** (to, from).  
  - Place them before nouns/pronouns: “I live **in** a house,” “She is **at** school.”  
  - Use with simple present: “He goes **to** the park,” “We are **in** the room.”  
  - Common in questions: “Where do you live?” → “**In** a city.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **in, on, at, to, from** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce prepositions clearly, keep them light, and use them in casual settings like texts or chats.
