### **Lesson 10: Simple Past Tense (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What is the Simple Past Tense?**
The simple past tense describes actions or states that happened in the **past** and are finished. It’s used for things you did earlier, like yesterday, last week, or any time before now.  
- Example: “I **ate** rice.” (You ate rice yesterday, it’s done.)  
- Example: “She **was** happy.” (She felt happy before, not necessarily now.)  

This tense is super common in everyday English, like texting “I went to the park” or posting “It was awesome!” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Forming Simple Past with Action Verbs**
Most verbs form the past tense by adding **-ed** to the base verb, but some are **irregular** and have unique forms.  
- **Regular Verbs**: Add **-ed** (or **-d** if the verb ends in -e).  
  - Base verb: “walk” → Past: “walk**ed**”  
    - Example: “I **walked** to school.”  
  - Base verb: “like” → Past: “lik**ed**”  
    - Example: “She **liked** the movie.”  
- **Irregular Verbs**: Don’t follow the -ed rule; they have special forms.  
  - Examples: 
    - “go” → “**went**” (e.g., “I **went** to the park.”)  
    - “eat” → “**ate**” (e.g., “He **ate** rice.”)  
    - “sing” → “**sang**” (e.g., “They **sang** a song.”)  
- **Structure**: **Subject + Past Verb (+ Object)**  
  - Example: “I **played** a game.”  
  - Example: “He **went** to the shop.”  
- **Note**: The verb form is the same for all subjects (I, you, he, she, it, we, they). No need to add “-s” like in the present tense.  
  - Example: “She **walked**” (not “walkeds”).  

#### **2. Simple Past with “To Be” (was, were)**
The verb “to be” in the past tense uses **was** or **were** to describe past states.  
- Structure: **Subject + Was/Were (+ Adjective/Noun/Preposition)**  
- For **I, He, She, It**: Use **was**.  
  - Example: “I **was** happy.”  
  - Example: “She **was** at home.”  
- For **You, We, They**: Use **were**.  
  - Example: “We **were** tired.”  
  - Example: “They **were** in the park.”  

#### **3. Negative Sentences in Simple Past**
- **With Action Verbs**: Use **did not** (or **didn’t**) + **base verb**.  
  - Example: “I **didn’t** like the food.” (Base verb: like, no -ed.)  
  - Example: “She **didn’t** go to school.” (Base verb: go.)  
  - **Note**: Use **didn’t** for all subjects (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) and always the **base verb** (not “didn’t went”).  
- **With “To Be”**: Use **was not** (or **wasn’t**) or **were not** (or **weren’t**).  
  - Example: “He **wasn’t** at the party.”  
  - Example: “They **weren’t** happy.”  

#### **4. Questions in Simple Past**
- **With Action Verbs**: Use **Did + Subject + Base Verb (+ Object)?**  
  - Example: “**Did** you **play** a game?” (Base verb: play.)  
  - Example: “**Did** she **go** to the shop?” (Base verb: go.)  
  - Answers: “Yes, I **did**.” or “No, I **didn’t**.”  
    - Example: “Did you eat rice?” → “Yes, I **ate** rice.”  
- **With “To Be”**: Use **Was/Were + Subject (+ Adjective/Noun/Preposition)?**  
  - Example: “**Was** he happy?”  
  - Example: “**Were** they at school?”  
  - Answers: “Yes, he **was**.” or “No, he **wasn’t**.”  

#### **5. Combining with Adjectives, Adverbs, and Prepositions**
The simple past works with **adjectives**, **adverbs**, **prepositions**, and **articles** from earlier lessons.  
- Example: “I **ate** **a** **tasty** apple **in** the kitchen **yesterday**.” (A = article, tasty = adjective, in = preposition, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Example: “She **wasn’t** **at** the **big** party.” (At = preposition, big = adjective.)  
- Example: “**Did** he **sing** **well**?” (Well = adverb.)

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (past tense verbs and related words) for everyday conversations:  
1. **Ate** (past of eat)  
   - Example: “I **ate** a pizza.”  
2. **Went** (past of go)  
   - Example: “She **went** to school.”  
3. **Was** (past of be, for I/He/She/It)  
   - Example: “He **was** happy.”  
4. **Were** (past of be, for You/We/They)  
   - Example: “We **were** at the park.”  
5. **Yesterday** (a time in the past)  
   - Example: “I **played** a game **yesterday**.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: These words are super common in storytelling or casual chats. Notice them in texts or posts, like “I went to the mall” or “It was fun.” Try saying one aloud, like “I ate rice yesterday,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with the simple past, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “Ate” sounds like /eɪt/ (like “eight”).  
  - “Went” sounds like /wɛnt/ (like “sent”).  
  - “Was” sounds like /wəz/ (short, like “buzz”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “Ate, ate, ate.”  
- **Stress the Verb for Past Events**: In English, stressing the past verb emphasizes the action.  
  - Example: “I *ATE* a pizza!” (Stress “ate” to sound excited.)  
  - Example: “She *WENT* to the park!” (Stress “went” to highlight the trip.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using the past tense when talking about your day, like “I was at home” or “I ate rice” when texting or chatting.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for past tense (e.g., “I went there yesterday” or “It was so cool”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “I **went** to the park **yesterday**.”  
- Stress the verb and time: “I *WENT* to the park *YESTERDAY*.”  
- Try it like you’re telling a friend about your day.

### **Modern Examples**
The simple past tense is everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “I **ate** **a** pizza **yesterday** 🍕” (ate = past verb, a = article, yesterday = adverb).  
- Text to a friend: “She **was** **at** the mall 🛍️” (was = past be, at = preposition).  
- Tweet: “We **went** to **the** beach 🌊” (went = past verb, the = article).  
- YouTube comment: “It **wasn’t** **that** fun 😕” (wasn’t = negative past, that = demonstrative).  

These examples show how the simple past makes your sentences lively and perfect for modern, casual communication.

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Regular verbs: Add **-ed** (e.g., “I **walked**”).  
  - Irregular verbs: Learn special forms (e.g., go → **went**, eat → **ate**).  
  - “To be”: Use **was** (I/He/She/It) or **were** (You/We/They).  
  - Negatives: Use **didn’t** + base verb (e.g., “I **didn’t** like”) or **wasn’t/weren’t** (e.g., “She **wasn’t** happy”).  
  - Questions: Use **Did** + base verb (e.g., “**Did** you **play**?”) or **Was/Were** (e.g., “**Was** she happy?”).  
  - Combine with articles, adjectives, prepositions: “I **ate** **a** **tasty** apple **in** the kitchen.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **ate, went, was, were, yesterday** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce past verbs clearly, stress them for emphasis, and use them in casual settings like texts or chats.
