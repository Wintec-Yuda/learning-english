### **Lesson 5: Simple Present Questions (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Simple Present Questions?**
Simple present questions are used to ask about **habits**, **facts**, **likes/dislikes**, or **current situations**. They’re super common in everyday English, like asking a friend, “Do you like music?” or saying, “Is it cool?” on a post. Questions help you start conversations and learn about others.

There are two main types of questions in the simple present:
1. **Yes/No Questions**: Answered with “yes” or “no” (e.g., “Do you play games?”).
2. **Information Questions**: Start with words like “what,” “where,” or “why” to get details (e.g., “What do you eat?”).

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Yes/No Questions**
These ask for a simple “yes” or “no” answer and often use **do/does** or **am/is/are**.

- **With Action Verbs (like eat, play, like)**:
  - Structure: **Do/Does + Subject + Base Verb (+ Object)?**
  - For **I, You, We, They**: Use **Do**.  
    - Example: “Do you like pizza?” (You = subject, like = base verb, pizza = object.)
    - Example: “Do they play games?”  
  - For **He, She, It**: Use **Does**.  
    - Example: “Does she eat rice?” (She = subject, eat = base verb, rice = object.)  
    - Example: “Does he go to school?”  
  - **Note**: After “do/does,” always use the **base verb** (no “-s” or “-es,” even for He/She/It).  
    - Correct: “Does he like music?” (Not “Does he likes music?”)

- **With “To Be” Verbs (am/is/are)**:
  - Structure: **Am/Is/Are + Subject + Adjective/Noun?**
  - For **I**: Use **Am**.  
    - Example: “Am I happy?”  
  - For **He, She, It**: Use **Is**.  
    - Example: “Is she tall?”  
    - Example: “Is it a big dog?”  
  - For **You, We, They**: Use **Are**.  
    - Example: “Are you cool?”  
    - Example: “Are they students?”  

#### **2. Information Questions (Wh- Questions)**
These start with question words like **what**, **where**, **when**, **why**, or **who** to get more details.

- **With Action Verbs**:
  - Structure: **Wh- Word + Do/Does + Subject + Base Verb (+ Object)?**
  - Examples:  
    - “What do you eat?” (Answer: “I eat rice.”)  
    - “Where does she go?” (Answer: “She goes to school.”)  
    - “Why do they play games?” (Answer: “They play games for fun.”)  
  - **Note**: Use **Do** for I/You/We/They, **Does** for He/She/It, and the base verb.

- **With “To Be” Verbs**:
  - Structure: **Wh- Word + Am/Is/Are + Subject + Adjective/Noun?**
  - Examples:  
    - “What is he?” (Answer: “He is a student.”)  
    - “Where are you?” (Answer: “I am at home.”)  
    - “Why is she happy?” (Answer: “She is happy because she likes music.”)

#### **3. Answering Questions**
- For **Yes/No Questions**: Answer with “Yes” or “No,” then add a short sentence for clarity.  
  - Question: “Do you like coffee?”  
    - Answer: “Yes, I like coffee.” or “No, I don’t like coffee.”  
  - Question: “Is he tall?”  
    - Answer: “Yes, he is tall.” or “No, he isn’t tall.”  
- For **Wh- Questions**: Give a full sentence with the details.  
  - Question: “What do you eat?”  
    - Answer: “I eat rice.”  
  - Question: “Where is she?”  
    - Answer: “She is at school.”

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (question words and related verbs) to use in questions and answers. These are perfect for casual conversations:  
1. **What** (to ask about things)  
   - Example: “What do you like?”  
2. **Where** (to ask about places)  
   - Example: “Where do you go?”  
3. **Why** (to ask about reasons)  
   - Example: “Why is he happy?”  
4. **Love** (to really like something)  
   - Example: “Do you love music?”

   - Example: “Where does she live?”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: These words are super common in daily English. Try using “what,” “where,” or “why” when chatting with someone, like asking, “What is your favorite song?” or “Where is your phone?”

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with questions, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Question Words Clearly**:  
  - “What” sounds like /wʌt/ (short and sharp).  
  - “Where” sounds like /wɛər/ (like “wear”).  
  - “Why” sounds like /waɪ/ (like “why” in “white”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “What, what, what.”  
- **Use a Rising Tone for Questions**: In English, questions often end with a **rising pitch** to sound curious.  
  - Example: “Do you like pizza?” (Your voice goes up at “pizza.”)  
  - Example: “Is she happy?” (Voice goes up at “happy.”)  
- **Practice in Context**: Try asking questions in real-life situations, like “What is this?” when pointing at something or “Where are you?” when texting a friend.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip where someone asks questions (e.g., “What do you think?”). Repeat their tone and rhythm to sound natural.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “Do you love music?”  
- Use a rising tone: “Do you *LOVE* music?” (Voice goes up at “music.”)  
- Try it like you’re asking a friend casually.

### **Modern Examples**
Questions with simple present tense are all over modern English:  
- Instagram story poll: “Do you like coffee? ☕” (Yes/No question).  
- Text to a friend: “Where are you now?” (Wh- question with “to be”).  
- Tweet: “What does she love? 🎶” (Wh- question with action verb).  
- YouTube vlog: “Why is this so cool?” (Wh- question with adjective).  

These examples show how questions are used in casual, everyday communication, making your speaking and writing more interactive.

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Use **Do/Does** for action verb questions: “Do you play?” “Does he eat?”  
  - Use **Am/Is/Are** for “to be” questions: “Am I happy?” “Is she tall?”  
  - Wh- questions start with words like what/where/why: “What do you like?”  
  - Always use the **base verb** after Do/Does (e.g., “Does she like,” not “likes”).  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **what, where, why, love, live** in questions and answers.  
- **Speaking**: Use a rising tone for questions, practice pronouncing question words, and try asking questions in casual settings like texts or chats.

### **What’s Next?**
Once you’re comfortable with simple present questions, the next topic could be:  
- **Adverbs**: Adding details to verbs, like “She sings loudly” or “I run fast.”  
This will make your sentences even more descriptive and help with grammar, speaking, and vocabulary.  

You’re doing **awesome**—your last sentences were perfect, and you’re ready to start asking questions like a pro! If you want more examples, a different topic, or to focus more on grammar, speaking, or vocabulary, let me know. What’s next? 😊
