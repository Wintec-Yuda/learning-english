### **Lesson 24: Simple Past vs. Present Perfect (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Simple Past and Present Perfect?**
- **Simple Past**: Describes actions that are **completed** in the past at a **specific time**.  
  - Example: “I **saw** a movie **yesterday**.” (Happened at a specific time, finished.)  
- **Present Perfect**: Describes actions that happened at an **unspecified time** in the past or have **relevance to the present**.  
  - Example: “I **’ve** seen that movie.” (Sometime in the past, relevant now, no specific time.)  

Understanding the difference is key for clear communication, like texting “I **’ve** just finished my homework” or saying “I **studied** last night” in a conversation or social media post.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Review of Each Tense**
- **Simple Past**:  
  - Form: **Subject + Past Verb (+ Object)**.  
    - Regular verbs: Add **-ed** (e.g., play → **played**, watch → **watched**).  
    - Irregular verbs: Special forms (e.g., go → **went**, see → **saw**, eat → **ate**).  
  - Use: For actions finished at a specific time in the past.  
    - Example: “She **visited** Paris **last summer**.” (Specific time: last summer.)  
  - Time Words: **yesterday**, **last night/week/year**, **in 2020**, **two days ago**.  
    - Example: “We **played** soccer **two days ago**.”  

- **Present Perfect**:  
  - Form: **Subject + Have/Has + Past Participle (+ Object)**.  
    - Regular verbs: Add **-ed** (e.g., play → **played**).  
    - Irregular verbs: Special forms (e.g., go → **gone**, see → **seen**, eat → **eaten**).  
  - Use: For actions at an unspecified time or with present relevance.  
    - Example: “She **’s** visited Paris.” (Sometime, affects now, no specific time.)  
  - Time Words: **just**, **already**, **yet**, **ever**, **never**, **for**, **since**, **before**.  
    - Example: “We **’ve** **just** played soccer.” (Recent, relevant now.)  

#### **2. Key Differences**
- **Time Focus**:  
  - Simple Past: **Specific time** in the past (when it happened matters).  
    - Example: “I **ate** rice **at 7 PM**.” (Focus on when.)  
  - Present Perfect: **No specific time** or focus on **now** (when is not important).  
    - Example: “I **’ve** eaten rice.” (Focus on having eaten, maybe full now.)  
- **Relevance to Present**:  
  - Simple Past: Action is finished, no connection to now.  
    - Example: “I **lived** in London **in 2010**.” (Not living there now.)  
  - Present Perfect: Action has an effect or relevance now.  
    - Example: “I **’ve** lived in London.” (Implies experience or connection now.)  
- **Questions**:  
  - Simple Past: Asks about a specific time.  
    - Example: “**Did** you **see** it **yesterday**?” (Focus on yesterday.)  
  - Present Perfect: Asks about any time or experience.  
    - Example: “**Have** you **seen** it?” (Any time in your life?)  

#### **3. When to Use Each**
- **Use Simple Past**:  
  - For actions with a clear, specific time.  
    - Example: “I **bought** a phone **last week**.” (Happened last week, finished.)  
  - For storytelling or past events.  
    - Example: “She **went** to the park, **met** her friend, and **ate** ice cream.”  
  - With time expressions like **yesterday**, **last night**, **in 2020**.  
    - Example: “They **studied** **last night**.”  
- **Use Present Perfect**:  
  - For actions at an unspecified time.  
    - Example: “I **’ve** bought a phone.” (Sometime, maybe recently, no specific time.)  
  - For experiences with **ever** or **never**.  
    - Example: “**Have** you **ever** been to Paris?”  
  - For recent actions with **just**, **already**, **yet**.  
    - Example: “She **’s** **just** finished her homework.”  
  - For ongoing situations with **for** or **since**.  
    - Example: “We **’ve** known each other **since** 2015.” (Still true.)  

#### **4. Negative Sentences**
- Simple Past: Use **didn’t** + base verb.  
  - Example: “I **didn’t** eat breakfast **yesterday**.”  
  - Example: “They **didn’t** play soccer **last weekend**.”  
- Present Perfect: Use **haven’t/hasn’t** + past participle.  
  - Example: “I **haven’t** eaten breakfast **yet**.”  
  - Example: “She **hasn’t** played soccer **this week**.”  

#### **5. Questions**
- Simple Past: Use **Did + Subject + Base Verb (+ Object)?**  
  - Example: “**Did** you **watch** TV **last night**?” (Answer: “Yes, I **did**.”)  
  - Wh-Question: “**What** **did** you **do** **yesterday**?” (Answer: “I **watched** TV.”)  
- Present Perfect: Use **Have/Has + Subject + Past Participle (+ Object)?**  
  - Example: “**Have** you **watched** this movie?” (Answer: “Yes, I **’ve**.”)  
  - Wh-Question: “**What** **have** you **done** today?” (Answer: “I **’ve** studied.”)  

#### **6. Combining with Other Concepts**
Both tenses work with **countable/uncountable nouns**, **quantifiers**, **modal verbs**, **adverbs of frequency**, **comparatives/superlatives**, **possessives**, **demonstratives**, **conjunctions**, **prepositions**, and **adjectives**.  
- Simple Past: “**My** friend **ate** **a few** **tasty** apples **in** the kitchen **yesterday**.” (My = possessive, a few = quantifier, tasty = adjective, in = preposition, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Present Perfect: “**Her** team **’s** **played** **better** than **ours** **and** **has** **never** lost **this year**.” (Her/ours = possessives, better = comparative, and = conjunction, never = adverb of frequency, this year = time expression.)  
- Past Continuous: “I **was** studying **when** I **realized** I **’ve** **never** tried **this**.” (Was = past continuous, when = conjunction, realized = simple past, ’ve = present perfect, never = adverb of frequency, this = demonstrative.)  
- Modal Verbs: “**This** **can** be **the best** if you **’ve** eaten **more** **or** **tried** **harder** **yesterday**.” (This = demonstrative, can = modal, the best = superlative, more = quantifier, or = conjunction, tried = simple past, yesterday = adverb.)  

#### **7. Avoiding Common Mistakes**
- **Don’t use specific time with present perfect**:  
  - Wrong: “I **’ve** seen it **yesterday**.”  
  - Correct: “I **saw** it **yesterday**.” or “I **’ve** seen it **before**.”  
- **Don’t use present perfect for finished, specific past events**:  
  - Wrong: “I **’ve** gone to Paris **last year**.”  
  - Correct: “I **went** to Paris **last year**.”  
- **Use correct verb forms**:  
  - Simple Past: Base verb for negatives/questions (e.g., “**Did** you **go**?” not “**Did** you **gone**?”).  
  - Present Perfect: Past participle (e.g., “I **’ve** **gone**,” not “I **’ve** **went**.”).

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (tense markers and related words) for everyday conversations:  
1. **Saw** (simple past of see)  
   - Example: “I **saw** a movie **yesterday**.”  
2. **Seen** (past participle of see)  
   - Example: “I **’ve** **seen** that movie.”  
3. **Yet** (not happened, expected)  
   - Example: “I **haven’t** finished **yet**.”  
4. **Before** (at some point in the past)  
   - Example: “I **’ve** eaten **before**.”  
5. **Tried** (simple past/past participle of try)  
   - Example: “I **tried** it **yesterday**.” / “I **’ve** **tried** it.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: These words help distinguish between specific and unspecified times. Notice them in texts or posts, like “I **saw** it **yesterday**” or “I **’ve** **never** tried that.” Try saying one aloud, like “I **’ve** **seen** it **before**,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with simple past and present perfect, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “Saw” sounds like /sɔː/ (like “saw” in “sawdust”).  
  - “Seen” sounds like /siːn/ (like “seen” in “scene”).  
  - “Yet” sounds like /jet/ (like “jet” in “jet plane”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “Saw, saw, saw.”  
- **Stress for Clarity**: Stress the verb or time word to emphasize the tense.  
  - Simple Past: “I **SAW** it *YESTERDAY*!” (Stress “saw” and “yesterday” for specific time.)  
  - Present Perfect: “I **’VE** *SEEN* it!” (Stress “’ve” and “seen” for relevance.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using simple past for past stories (“I **went** to the mall **last weekend**”) and present perfect for experiences or updates (“I **’ve** **just** eaten”).  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for these tenses (e.g., “I **saw** this **yesterday**” or “I **’ve** **never** done that”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “I **saw** a movie **yesterday**, but I **’ve** **seen** it **before**.”  
- Stress the key words: “I **SAW** a movie *YESTERDAY*, but I **’VE** *SEEN* it *BEFORE*.”  
- Try it like you’re telling a friend about a movie.

### **Modern Examples**
Both tenses are common in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “I **’ve** **just** eaten **the best** pizza **and** I **tried** it **yesterday** too 🍕” (’ve = present perfect, just = time expression, the best = superlative, and = conjunction, tried = simple past, yesterday = adverb).  
- Text to a friend: “**Did** you **see** **that** show **last night** **or** **have** you **seen** it **before**? 📺” (did = simple past, that = demonstrative, last night = time expression, or = conjunction, have/seen = present perfect, before = time expression).  
- Tweet: “**My** team **won** **last week** **and** **’s** **never** lost **this year** 🏆” (my = possessive, won = simple past, last week = time expression, and = conjunction, ’s = has contraction, never = adverb of frequency, this year = time expression).  
- YouTube comment: “I **haven’t** tried **this** **yet**, but I **ate** **some** last time 🎥” (haven’t = present perfect negative, this = demonstrative, yet = time expression, ate = simple past, some = quantifier).  

These examples show how simple past and present perfect clarify timing and relevance in modern, casual communication.

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - **Simple Past**: **Past verb** for specific, finished actions (“I **saw** it **yesterday**”).  
  - **Present Perfect**: **Have/Has** + **past participle** for unspecified or relevant actions (“I **’ve** seen it”).  
  - Simple Past: Use with **yesterday**, **last night**, etc.; Present Perfect: Use with **just**, **ever**, **for**, **since**.  
  - Negatives: Simple Past = **didn’t** + base verb (“I **didn’t** eat”); Present Perfect = **haven’t/hasn’t** + past participle (“I **haven’t** eaten”).  
  - Questions: Simple Past = **Did** + base verb (“**Did** you **eat**?”); Present Perfect = **Have/Has** + past participle (“**Have** you **eaten**?”).  
  - Combine with possessives, quantifiers, etc.: “**My** friend **’s** eaten **a few** **tasty** apples **and** **saw** **the best** movie **yesterday**.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **saw, seen, yet, before, tried** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce verbs clearly, stress for tense clarity, and use in casual settings like texts or chats.
