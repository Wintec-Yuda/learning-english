### **Lesson 13: Conjunctions (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Conjunctions?**
Conjunctions are words that **connect** words, phrases, or sentences to show relationships between them. They help you combine ideas to make your sentences smoother and more interesting.  
- Example: “I like tea **and** coffee.” (And connects tea and coffee.)  
- Example: “She is tired **but** happy.” (But shows a contrast.)  

Conjunctions are super common in everyday English, like texting “I’m hungry **and** tired” or posting “I want to go **but** I’m busy” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Types of Conjunctions**
This lesson focuses on three basic **coordinating conjunctions** that are easy for beginners:  
- **And**: Adds or combines ideas (shows addition).  
  - Example: “I eat rice **and** chicken.” (Combines two things I eat.)  
- **But**: Shows contrast or difference between ideas.  
  - Example: “I like music **but** not loud music.” (Contrasts two ideas.)  
- **Or**: Shows a choice or alternative between ideas.  
  - Example: “Do you want tea **or** coffee?” (Offers two options.)  

#### **2. Using Conjunctions to Connect Words or Phrases**
- **Connecting Nouns**:  
  - Example: “**My** cat **and** dog are cute.” (And connects cat and dog.)  
  - Example: “I can wear a shirt **or** a dress.” (Or connects shirt and dress.)  
- **Connecting Adjectives**:  
  - Example: “The house is big **and** beautiful.” (And connects big and beautiful.)  
  - Example: “She is smart **but** shy.” (But connects smart and shy.)  
- **Connecting Verbs or Actions**:  
  - Example: “I sing **and** dance.” (And connects sing and dance.)  
  - Example: “He wants to play **but** can’t.” (But connects wants and can’t.)  

#### **3. Using Conjunctions to Connect Sentences**
Conjunctions can join two complete sentences (called independent clauses) with a comma before the conjunction.  
- Structure: **Sentence + , + Conjunction + Sentence**  
- Examples:  
  - And: “I went to the park**, and** I played a game.” (Combines two related actions.)  
  - But: “I wanted to go**, but** it rained.” (Shows a contrast.)  
  - Or: “I can study now**, or** I can study later.” (Shows a choice.)  
- **Note**: The comma is optional when connecting short sentences, but it’s common in writing.  
  - Example: “I like tea **and** I like coffee.” (No comma, short sentences.)  

#### **4. Combining with Simple Present, Simple Past, and Other Concepts**
Conjunctions work with **simple present**, **simple past**, **adjectives**, **prepositions**, **articles**, **adverbs**, **demonstratives**, and **possessives** from earlier lessons.  
- Simple Present: “**This** cat is cute **and** friendly **in** the house.” (This = demonstrative, in = preposition.)  
- Simple Past: “**My** friend **was** happy **but** tired **yesterday**.” (My = possessive, was = past, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Negative: “**The** book **isn’t** big **or** heavy.” (The = article, isn’t = negative.)  
- Question: “**Is** **this** yours **or** **hers**?” (Is = present question, this = demonstrative, hers = possessive pronoun.)  

#### **5. Conjunctions in Questions and Negatives**
Conjunctions appear in **questions** and **negative sentences**.  
- Questions:  
  - Example: “Do you like tea **or** coffee?” (Answer: “I like tea.”)  
  - Example: “**Was** she happy **and** excited?” (Answer: “Yes, she **was**.”)  
- Negatives:  
  - Example: “I **don’t** like loud music **or** noisy places.” (Don’t = negative.)  
  - Example: “**This** **wasn’t** fun **but** it **was** interesting.” (Wasn’t = negative, this = demonstrative.)

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (conjunctions and related nouns) for everyday conversations:  
1. **And** (adds ideas)  
   - Example: “I like cats **and** dogs.”  
2. **But** (shows contrast)  
   - Example: “I’m hungry **but** tired.”  
3. **Or** (shows choice)  
   - Example: “Tea **or** coffee?”  
4. **Place** (a location, countable)  
   - Example: “I go to school **and** the park.”  
5. **Time** (a period or moment, uncountable)  
   - Example: “I study **in** the morning **or** evening.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: Conjunctions are used all the time to link ideas. Notice them in texts or posts, like “I’m tired **but** happy” or “Coffee **or** tea?” Try saying one aloud, like “I want rice **and** chicken,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with conjunctions, focus on pronunciation, flow, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “And” sounds like /ænd/ (or /ən/ in fast speech, like “an”).  
  - “But” sounds like /bʌt/ (like “but” in “butter”).  
  - “Or” sounds like /ɔːr/ (like “or” in “order”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “And, and, and.”  
- **Pause Slightly Before Conjunctions**: In English, a slight pause before conjunctions makes sentences clearer, especially with **but** or **or**.  
  - Example: “I like tea… **but** I love coffee!” (Pause before “but” for contrast.)  
  - Example: “Tea… **or** coffee?” (Pause before “or” to show choice.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using conjunctions when talking, like “I’m busy **and** tired” when texting or “I can go now **or** later” when planning.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for conjunctions (e.g., “I ate pizza **and** pasta” or “I wanted to stay **but** left”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “I like tea **and** coffee.”  
- Pause slightly: “I like tea… *and* coffee.”  
- Try it like you’re telling a friend your preferences.

### **Modern Examples**
Conjunctions are everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “I’m tired **but** happy 😊” (but = contrast).  
- Text to a friend: “Want tea **or** coffee? ☕” (or = choice).  
- Tweet: “**My** cat **and** dog are cute 🐾” (and = addition, my = possessive).  
- YouTube comment: “**This** **was** fun **and** exciting 🎉” (this = demonstrative, was = past).  

These examples show how conjunctions make your sentences connected and engaging in modern, casual communication.

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Use **and** to add ideas, **but** for contrast, **or** for choices.  
  - Connect words/phrases: “Cats **and** dogs.”  
  - Connect sentences: “I went to the park**, and** I played.” (Comma optional for short sentences.)  
  - Combine with present/past, adjectives, prepositions: “**This** **big** cat **is** cute **and** friendly **in** the house.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **and, but, or, place, time** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce conjunctions clearly, pause slightly for clarity, and use them in casual settings like texts or chats.
