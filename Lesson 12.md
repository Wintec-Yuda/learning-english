# Possessives Material

## What are Possessives?
Possessives show **ownership** or relationships, indicating who something belongs to.  
- Example: “**My** phone is new.” (My = phone belongs to me.)  
- Example: “This is **hers**.” (Hers = her thing.)  

## Grammar Rules
1. **Possessive Adjectives**: Before nouns (**my**, **your**, **his**, **her**, **its**, **our**, **their**).  
   - Example: “**My** cat is cute.”  
2. **Possessive Pronouns**: Replace nouns (**mine**, **yours**, **his**, **hers**, **its**, **ours**, **theirs**).  
   - Example: “This is **mine**.” (Mine = my thing.)  
3. **Chart**:  
   - I: **my** (adjective), **mine** (pronoun)  
   - You: **your**, **yours**  
   - He: **his**, **his**  
   - She: **her**, **hers**  
   - It: **its**, **its**  
   - We: **our**, **ours**  
   - They: **their**, **theirs**  
4. **With Other Concepts**:  
   - Present: “**My** cat **is** cute **in** the house.”  
   - Past: “**Her** party **was** fun **yesterday**.”  
   - Negative: “**This** **isn’t** **my** book.”  
   - Question: “**Is** **this** **your** phone?”  
5. **No Articles with Pronouns**: “This is **mine**,” not “**the mine**.”
