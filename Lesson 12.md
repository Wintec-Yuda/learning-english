### **Lesson 12: Possessives (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Possessives?**
Possessives are words that show **ownership** or a relationship between people, things, or ideas. They tell us who something belongs to or is associated with.  
- Example: “**My** phone is new.” (My shows the phone belongs to you.)  
- Example: “**Her** book is on the table.” (Her shows the book belongs to her.)  

Possessives are super common in everyday English, like texting “**My** coffee is cold” or posting “**His** dog is cute” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Types of Possessives**
- **Possessive Adjectives**: Used before a noun to show ownership.  
  - Examples: **my**, **your**, **his**, **her**, **its**, **our**, **their**  
  - Structure: **Possessive Adjective + Noun**  
    - Example: “**My** cat is cute.” (My describes the cat.)  
    - Example: “**Their** house is big.” (Their describes the house.)  
- **Possessive Pronouns**: Used alone to replace a noun and show ownership, avoiding repetition.  
  - Examples: **mine**, **yours**, **his**, **hers**, **its**, **ours**, **theirs**  
  - Structure: Used without a noun.  
    - Example: “This is **my** book.” → “It’s **mine**.” (Mine replaces “my book.”)  
    - Example: “Is this **your** phone?” → “Yes, it’s **yours**.” (Yours replaces “your phone.”)  
  - **Note**: **His** and **its** are the same for both adjective and pronoun forms.  

#### **2. Possessive Adjectives vs. Pronouns**
- **Possessive Adjectives**: Always followed by a noun.  
  - Example: “**Her** bag is new.” (Her describes bag.)  
  - Example: “**Our** friends are here.” (Our describes friends.)  
- **Possessive Pronouns**: Replace the noun to avoid repetition.  
  - Example: “This bag is **hers**.” (Hers = her bag.)  
  - Example: “These books are **ours**.” (Ours = our books.)  
- **Note**: Don’t use articles (**a**, **an**, **the**) with possessive pronouns.  
  - Correct: “This is **mine**.” (Not “This is **the mine**.”)  

#### **3. Possessive Adjectives and Pronouns Chart**
| Subject  | Possessive Adjective | Possessive Pronoun |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| I        | my                  | mine              |
| You      | your                | yours             |
| He       | his                 | his               |
| She      | her                 | hers              |
| It       | its                 | its               |
| We       | our                 | ours              |
| They     | their               | theirs            |

- Examples:  
  - Adjective: “**My** phone is cool.” → Pronoun: “It’s **mine**.”  
  - Adjective: “**Their** dogs are big.” → Pronoun: “They’re **theirs**.”  

#### **4. Combining with Simple Present, Simple Past, and Other Concepts**
Possessives work with **simple present**, **simple past**, **adjectives**, **prepositions**, **articles**, **adverbs**, and **demonstratives** from earlier lessons.  
- Simple Present: “**My** cat **is** cute **in** the house.” (My = possessive, is = present, in = preposition.)  
- Simple Past: “**Her** party **was** fun **yesterday**.” (Her = possessive, was = past, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Negative: “**This** isn’t **my** book.” (This = demonstrative, isn’t = negative.)  
- Question: “**Is** **this** **your** phone?” (Is = present question, this = demonstrative.)  
- With Adjective: “**Their** **big** house **is** nice.” (Big = adjective.)  

#### **5. Possessives in Questions and Negatives**
Possessives are common in **questions** and **negative sentences**.  
- Questions:  
  - Example: “**Is** **this** **your** bag?” (Answer: “Yes, it’s **mine**.”)  
  - Example: “**Did** **their** team win?” (Answer: “No, **theirs** **didn’t**.”)  
- Negatives:  
  - Example: “**This** **isn’t** **my** phone.” (Isn’t = negative.)  
  - Example: “**Her** book **wasn’t** **on** the table.” (Wasn’t = negative, on = preposition.)

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (possessives and related nouns) for everyday conversations:  
1. **My** (possessive adjective for I)  
   - Example: “**My** phone is new.”

3. **Mine** (possessive pronoun for I)

**Vocabulary Tip**: Possessives are used constantly in English to show ownership. Notice them in texts or posts, like “**My** coffee is here” or “This is **mine**!” Try saying one aloud, like “**My** bag is big,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with possessives, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “My” sounds like /maɪ/ (like “my” in “mighty”).  
  - “Your” sounds like /jɔːr/ (like “your” in “yours”).  
  - “Mine” sounds like /maɪn/ (like “mine” in “mineral”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “My, my, my.”  
- **Stress Possessives for Emphasis**: In English, stressing possessives highlights ownership.  
  - Example: “This is *MY* phone!” (Stress “my” to show it’s yours.)  
  - Example: “That book is *YOURS*!” (Stress “yours” to clarify.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using possessives when talking about your things, like “**My** drink is cold” when showing a friend or “This is **mine**” when claiming something.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for possessives (e.g., “**My** dog is cute” or “This is **hers**”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “**My** cat is cute.”  
- Stress the possessive: “*MY* cat is cute.”  
- Try it like you’re showing a friend your pet.

### **Modern Examples**
Possessives are everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “**My** coffee is amazing ☕” (my = possessive adjective).  
- Text to a friend: “Is this **your** phone? 📱” (your = possessive adjective).  
- Tweet: “This book is **mine** 📚” (mine = possessive pronoun).  
- YouTube comment: “**Their** party **wasn’t** fun 😕” (their = possessive adjective, wasn’t = negative).  

These examples show how possessives make your sentences personal and clear in modern, casual communication.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Possessive adjectives (**my**, **your**, **his**, **her**, **its**, **our**, **their**) go before nouns: “**My** cat.”  
  - Possessive pronouns (**mine**, **yours**, **his**, **hers**, **its**, **ours**, **theirs**) replace nouns: “It’s **mine**.”  
  - Don’t use articles with possessive pronouns: “This is **mine**,” not “**the mine**.”  
  - Combine with present/past, adjectives, prepositions: “**My** **big** cat **was** **in** the house **yesterday**.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **my, your, mine, yours, friend** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce possessives clearly, stress them for emphasis, and use them in casual settings like texts or chats.
