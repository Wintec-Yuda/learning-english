### **Lesson 11: Demonstratives (Grammar, Speaking, and Vocabulary)**

#### **What are Demonstratives?**
Demonstratives are words (**this**, **that**, **these**, **those**) that point to specific nouns, showing whether they are **near** or **far** and whether they are **singular** or **plural**. They act like adjectives (describing a noun) or pronouns (replacing a noun).  
- Example: “**This** book is good.” (Points to a specific book nearby.)  
- Example: “I like **those**.” (Replaces “those cats” far away.)  

Demonstratives are super common in everyday English, like saying “**This** is my phone” in a text or posting “**That** was fun!” on social media.

### **Key Grammar Concepts (Super Simple)**

#### **1. Types of Demonstratives**
- **This** (singular, near): Used for one thing close to you.  
  - Example: “**This** phone is new.” (The phone you’re holding.)  
- **That** (singular, far): Used for one thing farther away.  
  - Example: “**That** car is big.” (The car across the street.)  
- **These** (plural, near): Used for multiple things close to you.  
  - Example: “**These** books are interesting.” (Books on your table.)  
- **Those** (plural, far): Used for multiple things farther away.  
  - Example: “**Those** trees are tall.” (Trees in the distance.)  

#### **2. Demonstratives as Adjectives**
When used before a noun, demonstratives act like adjectives to point out which noun you mean.  
- Structure: **Demonstrative + Noun**  
  - Example: “**This** cat is cute.” (This describes the cat.)  
  - Example: “**Those** apples are red.” (Those describes the apples.)  
- **Note**: Use **this/these** for things **near** you (in space or time), and **that/those** for things **far** (in space or time).  
  - Near: “**This** coffee is hot.” (Coffee in your hand.)  
  - Far: “**That** movie was great.” (Movie you watched last week.)  

#### **3. Demonstratives as Pronouns**
When used alone, demonstratives replace the noun to avoid repetition.  
- Example: 
  - With noun: “**This** book is good.”  
  - As pronoun: “I like **this**.” (This = the book.)  
- Example: 
  - With noun: “**Those** songs are cool.”  
  - As pronoun: “I love **those**.” (Those = the songs.)  

#### **4. Combining with Simple Present, Simple Past, and Other Concepts**
Demonstratives work with **simple present**, **simple past**, **adjectives**, **prepositions**, **articles**, and **adverbs** from earlier lessons.  
- Simple Present: “**This** book **is** good **in** the library.” (Is = present, in = preposition.)  
- Simple Past: “**That** movie **was** fun **yesterday**.” (Was = past, yesterday = adverb.)  
- Negative: “**These** shoes **aren’t** comfortable.” (Aren’t = negative.)  
- Question: “**Is** **this** phone new?” (Is = present question.)  
- With Adjective: “**Those** **big** trees are tall.” (Big = adjective.)  

**Article Reminder**: Don’t use **a/an/the** with demonstratives before nouns, as **this/that/these/those** already specify the noun.  
- Correct: “**This** cat is cute.” (Not “**A** this cat.”)  
- Correct: “I like **the** cat.” or “I like **this** cat.”  

#### **5. Demonstratives in Questions and Negatives**
Demonstratives are common in **questions** and **negative sentences**.  
- Questions:  
  - Example: “**Is** **this** your book?” (Answer: “Yes, it **is**.”)  
  - Example: “**Did** you see **those** stars?” (Answer: “No, I **didn’t**.”)  
- Negatives:  
  - Example: “**This** **isn’t** my phone.” (Isn’t = negative.)  
  - Example: “I **didn’t** like **that** movie.” (Didn’t = negative.)

### **Vocabulary (New Words to Learn)**
Here are **5 simple, modern words** (demonstratives and related nouns) for everyday conversations:  
1. **This** (singular, near)  
   - Example: “**This** phone is cool.”  
2. **That** (singular, far)  
   - Example: “**That** song was great.”  
3. **These** (plural, near)  
   - Example: “**These** books are new.”  
4. **Those** (plural, far)  
   - Example: “**Those** cars are fast.”  
5. **Thing** (a general noun, countable)  
   - Example: “**This** thing is strange.”  

**Vocabulary Tip**: Demonstratives are used all the time in casual English. Notice them in texts or posts, like “**This** is my coffee” or “**Those** were fun times.” Try saying one aloud, like “**This** is my bag,” to practice.

### **Speaking Tips**
To improve your speaking with demonstratives, focus on pronunciation, tone, and confidence:  
- **Pronounce Clearly**:  
  - “This” sounds like /ðɪs/ (like “hiss” with “th”).  
  - “That” sounds like /ðæt/ (like “hat” with “th”).  
  - “These” sounds like /ðiːz/ (like “sees” with “th”).  
  - Say each word 3 times: “This, this, this.”  
- **Stress Demonstratives for Emphasis**: In English, stressing demonstratives points out something specific.  
  - Example: “*THIS* is my phone!” (Stress “this” to show it’s yours.)  
  - Example: “I loved *THAT* song!” (Stress “that” to highlight the song.)  
- **Use in Conversations**: Try using demonstratives when pointing to things, like “**This** is my drink” when showing a friend or “**That** was fun” when texting about an event.  
- **Imitate Native Speakers**: Watch a short TikTok or YouTube clip and listen for demonstratives (e.g., “**This** is so cool” or “**Those** are my shoes”). Repeat their sentences to copy their tone and rhythm.  

**Speaking Example**: Say this out loud: “**These** books are good.”  
- Stress the demonstrative: “*THESE* books are good.”  
- Try it like you’re showing a friend your books.

### **Modern Examples**
Demonstratives are everywhere in daily English:  
- Instagram caption: “**This** coffee is amazing ☕” (this = near, specific coffee).  
- Text to a friend: “**That** was **a** fun party 🎉” (that = far, past event, a = article).  
- Tweet: “**These** shoes are cool 😎” (these = near, plural shoes).  
- YouTube comment: “I **didn’t** like **those** movies 🎥” (those = far, didn’t = negative).  

These examples show how demonstratives make your sentences specific and engaging in modern, casual communication.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Grammar**:  
  - Use **this/these** for near (singular/plural), **that/those** for far (singular/plural).  
  - As adjectives: Before nouns (e.g., “**This** cat is cute”).  
  - As pronouns: Replace nouns (e.g., “I like **this**.” = this book.)  
  - Don’t use **a/an/the** with demonstratives before nouns: “**This** book,” not “**A** this book.”  
  - Combine with present/past, adjectives, prepositions: “**These** **tasty** apples **were** **in** the kitchen.”  
- **Vocabulary**: Learn and use **this, that, these, those, thing** in sentences.  
- **Speaking**: Pronounce demonstratives clearly, stress them for emphasis, and use them in casual settings like texts or chats.
