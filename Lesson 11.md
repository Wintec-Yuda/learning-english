# Demonstratives Material

## What are Demonstratives?
Demonstratives (**this**, **that**, **these**, **those**) point to specific nouns, showing if they are **near** or **far** and **singular** or **plural**.  
- Example: “**This** book is good.” (Near, singular.)  
- Example: “I like **those**.” (Far, plural, replaces nouns.)  

## Grammar Rules
1. **Types**:  
   - **This**: Singular, near (e.g., “**This** phone is new”).  
   - **That**: Singular, far (e.g., “**That** car is big”).  
   - **These**: Plural, near (e.g., “**These** books are interesting”).  
   - **Those**: Plural, far (e.g., “**Those** trees are tall”).  
2. **As Adjectives**: Before nouns (e.g., “**This** cat is cute”).  
3. **As Pronouns**: Replace nouns (e.g., “I like **this**.” = this book).  
4. **With Other Concepts**:  
   - Present: “**This** book **is** good **in** the library.”  
   - Past: “**That** movie **was** fun **yesterday**.”  
   - Negative: “**These** shoes **aren’t** comfortable.”  
   - Question: “**Is** **this** phone new?”  
5. **No Articles**: Use “**this** book,” not “**a** this book.”  

## Vocabulary
- **This**: Singular, near (e.g., “**This** phone is cool”).  
- **That**: Singular, far (e.g., “**That** song was great”).  
- **These**: Plural, near (e.g., “**These** books are new”).  
- **Those**: Plural, far (e.g., “**Those** cars are fast”).  
- **Thing**: General noun (e.g., “**This** thing is strange”).  

## Speaking Tips
- Pronounce clearly: “This” (/ðɪs/), “That” (/ðæt/), “These” (/ðiːz/).  
- Stress for emphasis: “*THIS* is my phone!”  
- Use in context: Say “**This** is my drink” when showing something.  
- Imitate: Repeat after videos (e.g., “**This** is so cool”).
